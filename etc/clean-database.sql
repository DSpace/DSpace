--  DSpace database cleaner
--
--    This SQL "cleans" a database used by a DSpace installation.  It removes
--    all tables etc. so the database is completely empty and ready for a
--    fresh installation.  Of course, this means all data is lost.
--
--    Caution: THIS IS POSTGRESQL-SPECIFC
--    * The sequences dropped below are automatically created by PostgreSQL
--      for the SERIAL typed fields.
--
--    This should be kept in sync if database_schema.sql is updated.


-- Drop indices
DROP INDEX dcvalue_dc_type_id_idx;
