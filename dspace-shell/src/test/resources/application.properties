# Spring Boot's application.properties
#
# This properties file is used by Spring Boot to initialize its ApplicationContext and configure
# default Spring beans. It also uses the "dspace.dir" custom setting to locate your DSpace installation,
# and load all DSpace services and configurations.
#
# WARNING: Because this properties file initializes Spring Boot, it loads *before* any DSpace specific
# configurations/settings. Therefore settings in this file CANNOT depend on any DSpace configurations.
# The *only* DSpace configuration allowed in this file is "dspace.dir", which is documented below.
#
# HOW TO OVERRIDE SPRING SETTINGS: Since the DSpace Configuration Service loads early in the Spring Boot
# startup process (see DSpaceConfigurationInitializer), most Spring Boot properties can be OVERRIDDEN in
# your local.cfg.
#
# Docs (including info on how to override these default settings)
#    http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html
# For common settings see:
#    http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html

# NOTE: this configuration is filled out by Apache Ant during the DSpace install/update process. It does NOT
