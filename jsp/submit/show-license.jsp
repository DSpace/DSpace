        <H1>Submit: Grant DSpace Distribution License</H1>

        <P><strong>There is one last step:</strong> In order for DSpace to reproduce, translate and distribute your
        submission worldwide, your agreement to the following terms is necessary.
        Please take a moment to read the terms of this license, and click on one of the
        buttons at the bottom of the page.  By clicking on the "Grant License"
        button, you indicate that you grant the following terms of the license.
        <dspace:popup page="/help/index.html#license">(More Help...)</dspace:popup></P>

        <P><strong>Not granting the license will not delete your submission.</strong>
        Your item will remain in your "My DSpace" page.  You can then either remove
        the submission from the system, or agree to the license later once any
        queries you might have are resolved.</P>
