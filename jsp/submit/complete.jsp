    <P>Your submission will now go through the workflow process designated for 
    the collection to which you are submitting.    You will receive e-mail
    notification as soon as your submission has become a part of the collection,
    or if for some reason there is a problem with your submission. You can also
    check on the status of your submission by going to the My DSpace page.</P>
