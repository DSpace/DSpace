  - Home page JSP
  -
  - Note that this is a "stand-alone" JSP that is invoked directly, and not
  - via a Servlet.  This is because the standard servlet 2.3 deployment
  - descriptor does not seem to allow a servlet to be deployed at "/" without
  - it becoming the servlet for dealing with every request to the site.
  -
  - This also means there's some business logic, basically some minimal stuff
  - from DSpaceServlet.java.  This shouldn't happen elsewhere in the JSPs.
