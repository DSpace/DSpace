    <H1>Invalid Identifier</H1>

    <P>The identifier <%= badID %> does not correspond to a valid
    <%= typeString %> in DSpace.  This may be because of one of the following
    reasons:</P>

    <UL>
        <LI>The URL of the current page is incorrect - if you followed a link
        from outside of DSpace it may be mistyped or corrupt.</LI>
        <LI>You entered an invalid ID into a form - please try again.</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>If you're having problems, or you expected the ID to work, feel free to
    contact the site administrators.</P>
