  - Location bar component
  -
  - This component displays the "breadcrumb" style navigation aid at the top
  - of most screens.
  -
  - Uses request attributes set in org.dspace.app.webui.jsptag.Layout, and
  - hence must only be used as part of the execution of that tag.  Plus,
  - dspace.layout.locbar should be verified to be true before this is included.
  -
  -  dspace.layout.parenttitles - List of titles of parent pages
  -  dspace.layout.parentlinks  - List of URLs of parent pages, empty string
  -                               for non-links
