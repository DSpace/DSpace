# This example skips all files and directories with a path name containing

SKIPCOND=(-path "*.nobackup*" -o -name "*.o")

# If you want to exclude several directories use the following expression:
# SKIPCOND=(-path '/path1' -o -path '/path1/*' -o -path '/path2' -o -path '/path2/*')

# NOTE: If you do not have anything to skip, use:

# User-defined archive drivers (optional)

# This section demonstrates how user-defined archive drivers can be added.
# The example shows a modified version of the "afioz" driver with some additional parameters
# one may want to pass to afio in order to tune the speed, archive size etc. .
# An archive driver consists of a bash function named
# "DRIVER_<your-driver-name>" implementing the (sometimes simple) operations "-test", "-suffix",
# "-create", "-toc", and "-extract".

# If you do not want to write your own archive driver, you can remove the remainder of this file.
