Provides an API for reading and manipulating content in the DSpace system.

<h2>The DSpace Data Model</h2>

Data in DSpace is stored in the model below.  Multiple inclusion is permitted
at every level; the documentation for each class describes the system's
behaviour for coping with this.

<table border="0" cellspacing=5>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Community</strong></td>
    <td>Communities correspond to organisational units within an
    institution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Collection</strong></td>
    <td>Collections are groupings of related content.  Each collection may
    have an associated <em>workflow</em>; this is the review process that
    submissions go through before being included in the archive.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Item</strong></td>
    <td>Items are the basic archival units.  An item corresponds to a single
    logical piece of content and associated metadata.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Bundle</strong></td>
    <td>Bundles are groupings of Bitstreams that make no sense in isolation;
    for example, the files making up an HTML document would all go in one
    Bundle.  A PDF version of the same Item, or a dataset stored with the Item,
    would go in a separate Bundle.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Bitstream</strong></td>
    <td>Bitstreams are sequences of bits, typically files, that make up the
    raw content of Items.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Additionally, each Bitstream is associated with one <strong>Bitstream
Format</strong>; this describes information about the format and encoding of
the Bitstream, including a name (for example "Adobe PDF"), a MIME type and a
support level.
<P>

Submissions are created as <strong>Workspace Items</strong>.  A Workspace Item
is an Item in progress.  Once item assembly is complete, one of two things may
happen:</P>

<ul>
  <li>If the Collection being submitted to has an associated workflow, it is
  started.  At this point the Workspace Item becomes a <strong>Workflow
  Item</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the Collection has no associated workflow, the Workspace Item is
  removed and the assembled Item is included in the Collection.</li>
</ul>

Workspace Items and Workflow Items may both be manipulated as In Progress
Submissions.


<h2>Using the Content Management API</h2>

The general paradigm for using DSpace is to create a <em>Context</em>; this is
akin to opening a connection to a database (which, coincidentally, is one of the
things that happens.)
<P>
The classes in this package are then used to create in-memory snapshots that
represent the corresponding logical objects stored in the system.  When the
reading or manipulating is done, the Context may either be <em>aborted</em>, in
which case any changes made are discarded, or <em>completed</em>, in which case
any changes made are committed to main DSpace storage.
</P>
<P>
If any error occurs if you are making changes, you should <em>abort</em> the
current context, since the in-memory snapshots might be in an inconsistent
state.
</P>
<P>
Typically, when changing a particular object in the system, the changes will
not be written to main DSpace storage unless <code>update</code> is called on
the object prior to Context completion.  Where this is not the case, it is
stated in the method documentation.
</P>
<P>
Instances of the classes in this package are tied to that Context; when the
Context has been finished with the objects essentially become invalid.
</P>
<P>
An example use of the Content Management API is shown below:
</P>

<pre>
try
{
    // Create a DSpace context
    context = new org.dspace.core.Context();

    // Set the current user
    context.setCurrentUser(authenticatedUser)

    // Create my new collection
    Collection c = Collection.create(context);
    c.setMetadata("name", "My New Collection");
    c.update();   // Updates the metadata within the context

    // Find an item
    item = Item.find(context, 1234);
    
    // Remove it from its old collections
    Collection[] colls = item.getCollections();
    colls[0].removeItem(item);
    
    // Add it to my new collection
    c.addItem(item);
   
    // All went well; complete the context so changes are written
    context.complete();
}
catch (SQLException se)
{
    // Something went wrong with the database; abort the context so
    // no changes are written
    context.abort();
}
catch (AuthorizeException ae)
{
    // authenticatedUser does not have permission to perform one of the
    // above actions, so no changes should be made at all.
    context.abort();
}

// The context will have been completed or aborted here, so it may
// no longer be used, nor any objects that were created with it (e.g. item)
