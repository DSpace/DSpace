 * Stream-oriented crosswalks are intended to be used for metadata
 * formats which are either (a) not XML-based, or (b) too bulky for the
 * DOM-ish in-memory model developed for the METS and IMSCP packagers.
 * The METS packagers (all subclasses of AbstractMETSDisseminator / AbstractMETSIngester
 * are equipped to call these crosswalks as well as the XML-based ones,
 * just refer to the desired crosswalk by its plugin name.
