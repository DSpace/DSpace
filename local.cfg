# local.cfg for DSpace
#
# Any configurations added to this file will automatically OVERRIDE configurations
# of the same name in any of the DSpace *.cfg files.
#
# While some sample configurations are provided below, you may also copy
# ANY configuration from ANY DSpace *.cfg file into this "local.cfg" to OVERRIDE
# its default value. This includes any of these files:
#    * [dspace]/config/dspace.cfg
#    * Or any configuration file that is loaded into 'dspace.cfg'
#     (see "include =" settings near the end of dspace.cfg for full list)
#
# You may also specify additional configuration files to load by simply adding:
# include = [file-path]
# The [file-path] should be relative to the [dspace]/config/ folder, e.g.
# include = modules/authentication-ldap.cfg
#
# Any commented out settings in this file are simply ignored. A configuration
# will only override another configuration if it has the EXACT SAME key/name.
# For example, including "dspace.dir" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "dspace.dir" in the dspace.cfg file.

# Full link your end users will use to access DSpace. In most cases, this will be the baseurl followed by

# Alternatively, you can use a url redirect or deploy the web application under the servlet container root.
# In this case, make sure to remove the /${dspace.ui} from the dspace.url property.

# Solr server/webapp.
# DSpace uses Solr for all search/browse capability (and for usage statistics by default).
# The included 'solr' webapp MUST be deployed to Tomcat for DSpace to function.

# HANDLE CONFIGURATION #

# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# By default, DSpace is configured to use http://hdl.handle.net/
# as the canonical URL prefix when generating dc.identifier.uri
# during submission, and in the 'identifier' displayed in JSPUI
# item record pages.
#
# If you do not subscribe to CNRI's handle service, you can change this
# to match the persistent URL service you use, or you can force DSpace
# to use your site's URL, eg.
#handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.url}/handle/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifer.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions), but it will alter the URL 
# in JSPUI's 'identifier' message on item record pages for existing items.
#
# If omitted, the canonical URL prefix will be http://hdl.handle.net/
#handle.canonical.prefix = http://hdl.handle.net/
