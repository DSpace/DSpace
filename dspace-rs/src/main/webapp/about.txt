#ResourceSync for Metadata Harvesting

This repository supports the ResourceSync protocol and the profile of ResourceSync for metadata harvesting.

##Documents Available

You should begin interacting with the service via the Capability List (where you will find a link to this document).

The Capability List will point you to a Resource List and a Change List Archive.

The Change List Archive will list all of the Change Lists available.

##Bitstream Records

Bitstreams listed in the Resource List and Change List documents can have the following form:

    <url>
        <loc>http://example.com/bitstream1</loc>
        <lastmod>2013-01-02T17:00:00Z</lastmod>
        <rs:ln rel="describedby" href="http://example.com/metadata-resource"/>
        <rs:ln rel="describedby" href="http://example.com/other-metadata"/>
        <rs:ln rel="collection" href="http://example.com/collection1"/>
    </url>

* describedBy indicates the metadata resources which describe this bitstream
* collection indicates the collections/sets this bitstream appears in

You may choose to selectively synchronise content based on the collection it appears in and whether it is described by
a metadata resource which is in a format you wish to consume.  You may also apply any other filtering rules at your
discretion.

##Metadata Records

Metadata records listed in the Resource List and Change List documents can have the following form:

    <url>
        <loc>http://example.com/metadata-resource</loc>
        <lastmod>2013-01-02T17:00:00Z</lastmod>
        <rs:ln rel="describes" href="http://example.com/bitstream1"/>
        <rs:ln rel="describedby" href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"/>
        <rs:ln rel="collection" href="http://example.com/collection1"/>
    </url>

* describes indicates the bitstreams which this metadata resource describes
* describedby indicates the metadata format that this particular serialisation of the metadata resource conforms to
* collection indicates the collections/sets this metadata resource appears in

You may choose to selectively synchronise content based on the collection it appears in.  You may also apply any other
filtering rules at your discretion.
