/**
 * Utility class for retrieving the size of the columns to be used in the browse tables,
 * and applying truncation to the strings that will be inserted into the tables.
 * 
 * Can be configured in dspace.cfg, with the following entries:
 * 
 * webui.browse.value_columns.max
 *   - the maximum number of characters in 'value' columns
 *     (0 is unlimited)
 *   
 * webui.browse.sort_columns.max
 *   - the maximum number of characters in 'sort' columns
 *     (0 is unlimited)
 *   
 * webui.browse.value_columns.omission_mark
 *   - a string to append to truncated values that will be entered into
 *     the value columns (ie. '...')
 *     
 * By default, the column sizes are '0' (unlimited), and no truncation is applied,
 * EXCEPT for Oracle, where we have to truncate the columns for it to work! (in which
 * case, both value and sort columns are by default limited to 2000 characters).
