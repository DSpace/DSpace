/**
 * Simple lightweight "framework" for managing plugins.
 * <p>
 * This is a superclass of all classes which are managed as self-named
 * plugins.  They must extend <code>SelfNamedPlugin</code> or its
 * subclass.
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, this has to be an <code>abstract class</code> because
 * an <code>interface</code> may not have static methods.  The
 * <code>pluginAliases</code> method is static so it can be invoked
 * without creating an instance, and thus let the aliases live in the
 * class itself so there is no need for name mapping in a separate
 * configuration file.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation in the
 * <code>PluginManager</code> class for more details.
