/**
 * Ingestion Crosswalk plugin -- translate an external metadata format
 * into DSpace native metadata.
 * <p>
 * This describes a plugin that translates an external XML
 * metadata format (e.g.  MODS) into the DSpace internal metadata
 * representation.  A crosswalk plugin may operate on different kinds of
 * DSpace Objects, so the concept of "metadata" encompasses the
 * qualified Dublin Core fields on Items, properties of Bitstreams, and
 * metadata on Collections and Communities.

     * Crosswalk metadata from external XML representation to DSpace
     * internal representations.  This version accepts metadata as a
     * <code>List</code> of JDOM XML elements.  It interprets the
     * contents of each element and adds the appropriate values to the
     * DSpace Object's internal metadata represenation.
     * <p>
     * Note that this method may be called several times for the same target
     * Item, if the metadata comes as several lists of elements, so it should
     * not add fixed metadata values on each or they may appear multiples times.
     * <p>
     * NOTE:  <br>
     * Most XML metadata standards (e.g.  MODS) are defined as a "root"
     * element which contains a sequence of "fields" that have the
     * descriptive information.  Some metadata containers have a
     * "disembodied" list of fields, rather than the root element, so
     * this <code>ingest</code> method is intended to accept that bare
     * list of fields.  However, it must also accept a list containing
     * only the "root" element for the metadata structure (e.g.  the
     * "mods:mods" wrapper in a MODS expression) as a member of the
     * list.  It can handle this case by calling the single-element
     * version of ingest() on the "root" element.
     * <p>
     * Some callers of the crosswalk plugin may not be careful about (or
     * capable of) choosing whether the list or element version should
     * be called.
     * <p>
     * @param context  DSpace context.
     * @param dso DSpace Object (Item, Bitstream, etc) to which new metadata gets attached.
     * @param metadata  List of XML Elements of metadata
