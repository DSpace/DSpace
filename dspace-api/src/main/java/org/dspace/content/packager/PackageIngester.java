/**
 * Plugin Interface to interpret a Submission Information Package (SIP)
 * and create (or replace) a DSpace item from its contents.
 * <p>
 * A package is a single data stream
 * containing enough information to construct an Item.  It can be
 * anything from an archive like a Zip file with a manifest and metadata,
 * to a simple manifest containing external references to the content,
 * to a self-contained file such as a PDF.  The interpretation
 * of the package is entirely at the discretion of the implementing class.
 * <p>
 * The ingest methods are also given an attribute-value
 * list of "parameters"  which may modify their actions.
 * The parameters list is a generalized mechanism to pass parameters
 * from the requestor to the packager, since different packagers will
 * understand different sets of parameters.
