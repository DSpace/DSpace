/**
 * Plugin Interface to produce Dissemination Information Package (DIP)
 * of a DSpace object.
 * <p>
 * An implementation translates DSpace objects to some external
 * "package" format.  A package is a single data stream (or file)
 * containing enough information to reconstruct the object.  It can be
 * anything from an archive like a Zip file with a manifest and metadata,
 * to a simple manifest containing external references to the content,
 * to a self-contained file such as a PDF.
 * <p>
 * A DIP implementation has two methods: <code>disseminate</code>
 * to produce the package itself, and <code>getMIMEType</code> to
 * identify its Internet format type (needed when transmitting the package
 * over HTTP).
 * <p>
 * Both of these methods are given an attribute-values
 * list of "parameters", which may modify their actions.  Since the
 * format output by <code>disseminate</code> may be affected by
 * parameters, it is given to the <code>getMIMEType</code> method as well.
 * The parameters list is a generalized mechanism to pass parameters
 * from the package requestor to the packager, since different packagers will
 * understand different sets of parameters.
