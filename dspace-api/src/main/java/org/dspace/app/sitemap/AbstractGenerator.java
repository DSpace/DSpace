/**
 * Base class for creating sitemaps of various kinds. A sitemap consists of one
 * or more files which list significant URLs on a site for search engines to
 * efficiently crawl. Dates of modification may also be included. A sitemap
 * index file that links to each of the sitemap files is also generated. It is
 * this index file that search engines should be directed towards.
 * <P>
 * Provides most of the required functionality, subclasses need just implement a
 * few methods that specify the "boilerplate" and text for including URLs.
 * <P>
 * Typical usage:
 * <pre>
 *   AbstractGenerator g = new FooGenerator(...);
 *   while (...) {
 *     g.addURL(url, date);
 *   }
 *   g.finish();
 * </pre>
