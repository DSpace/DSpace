<body>
<p>
Defines usage event instrumentation points and provides implementations for
testing.
</p>

<p>
This package makes usage instrumentation (for statistics, or whatever else
you may fancy) pluggable, while avoiding any unnecessary assumptions about how
usage events may be transmitted, persisted, or processed.
</p>

<p>
At appropriate points in the processing of user actions, events may be
assembled and "fired".  What happens when an event is fired is configurable
via the PluginManager.  One must configure a plugin for the AbstractUsageEvent
class, defined in this package, to select an event processing implementation.
</p>

<p>
Three "stock" implementations are provided.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>{@link org.dspace.app.statistics.PassiveUsageEvent PassiveUsageEvent}</dt>
	<dd>absorbs events without taking action, resulting in behavior identical
		to that of DSpace before this package was added.  This is the default
		if no plugin is configured.</dd>
	<dt>{@link org.dspace.app.statistics.UsageEventTabFileLogger UsageEventTabFileLogger}</dt>
	<dd>writes event records to a file in Tab Separated Values format.</dd>
	<dt>{@link org.dspace.app.statistics.UsageEventXMLLogger UsageEventXMLLogger}</dt>
	<dd>writes event records to a file in an XML format.  Suitable mainly for
		testing.</dd>
