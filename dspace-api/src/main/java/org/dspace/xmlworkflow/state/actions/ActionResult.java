/**
 * A class that represent the result of an {@link Action}.
 * The result consists of 2 parts:  a type and a result.
 *
 * <p>
 * The type is represented by an Enum and can be something like:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>TYPE_OUTCOME:</dt>         <dd>we have a certain outcome so move to another action/step.</dd>
 *   <dt>TYPE_ERROR:</dt>           <dd>an error has occurred while processing the action.</dd>
 *   <dt>TYPE_PAGE:</dt>
 *   <dt>TYPE_CANCEL:</dt>
 *   <dt>TYPE_SUBMISSION_PAGE:</dt>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>
 * The optional result integer is used to determine
 * the next step once the action has completed.
