      <p>Provides content fixity checking (using checksums)
          for bitstreams stored in DSpace software.</p>
      <p>The main access point to org.dspace.checker is on the command line
          via {@link org.dspace.app.checker.ChecksumChecker#main(String[])}, 
          but it is also simple to get programmatic access to ChecksumChecker 
          if you wish, via a {@link org.dspace.checker.CheckerCommand} object.</p>
      
      <p>CheckerCommand is a simple Command object. You initalize it with
         a strategy for iterating through bitstreams to check (an implementation of 
         {@link org.dspace.checker.BitstreamDispatcher}), and a object to collect
         the results (an implementation of @link org.dspace.checker.ChecksumResultsCollector})
         , and then call {@link org.dspace.checker.CheckerCommand#process()} 
         to begin the processing. CheckerCommand handles the calculation of bitstream 
         checksums and iteration between bitstreams.</p>
      
            
      <h2>BitstreamDispatcher</h2>
      <p>The order in which bitstreams are checked and when a checking run terminates 
      is controlled  by implementations of BitstreamDispatcher, and you can extend the 
      functionality of the package by writing your own implementatio of this simple 
      interface, although the package includes several useful implementations that will 
      probably suffice in most cases: - </p>
      
      <p>Dispatchers that generate bitstream ordering: -
      <ul>
        <li>{@link org.dspace.checker.ListDispatcher}</li>
        <li>{@link org.dspace.checker.SimpleDispatcher}</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Dispatchers that modify the behaviour of other Dispatchers: -
      <ul>
        <li>{@link org.dspace.checker.LimitedCountDispatcher}</li>
        <li>{@link org.dspace.checker.LimitedDurationDispatcher}</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>ChecksumResultsCollector</h2>
      <p>The default implementation of ChecksumResultsCollector 
      ({@link org.dspace.checker.ResultsLogger}) logs checksum checking to the db,
      but it would be simple to write your own implementation to log to LOG4J logs,
      text files, JMS queues etc.</p>
      
      <h2>Results Pruner</h2>
      <p>The results pruner is responsible for trimming the archived Checksum logs, 
      which can grow large otherwise. The retention period of stored check results 
      can be configured per checksum result code. This allows you, for example, to 
      retain records for all failures for auditing purposes, whilst discarding the 
      storage of successful checks. The pruner uses a default configuration from 
      dspace.cfg, but can take in alternative configurations from other properties
      files.</p>
          
      <h1>Design notes</h1>
      
      <p>All interaction between the checker package and the database is abstracted 
      behind DataAccessObjects. Where practicable dependencies on DSpace code are 
      minimized, the rationale being that it may be errors in DSpace code that 
      have caused fixity problems.</p>
