/**
 * Helper class for creating order delegates.
 *
 * To configure the filters create a subclass and, in an object initializer,
 * create an array of classes that implement TextFilter:
 * 
 * class MyLocaleDelegate extends AbstractTextFilterOFD {
 *   {
 *      filters = new TextFilter[] { new LocaleOrderingFilter(); }
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * The order they are in the array, is the order that they are executed.
 * (this may be important for some filters - read their documentation!)
 * 
 * Example configurations that could be used:
 * { new DecomposeDiactritics(), new StripDiacritics(), new LowerCaseAndTrim() }
 *    - Decompose and then strip the diacritics, lowercase and trim the string.
 *    
 * { new MARC21InitialArticleWord(), new DecomposeDiactritics(), new LowerCaseTrim() }
 *    - Parse the initial article words based on the Library of Congress list of
 *      definite/indefinite article words, decompose diacritics, and lowercase/trim.
 *
 * { new LowerCaseTrim(), new LocaleOrderingFilter() }
 *    - Lowercase the string, then make a locale dependent sort text
 *      (note that the sort text is not human readable)
