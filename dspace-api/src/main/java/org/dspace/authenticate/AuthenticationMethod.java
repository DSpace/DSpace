/**
 * Implement this interface to participate in the stackable
 * authentication mechanism.  See the <code>AuthenticationManager</code>
 * class for details about configuring authentication handlers.
 * <p>
 * Each <em>authentication method</em> provides a way to map
 * "credentials" supplied by the client into a DSpace e-person.
 * "Authentication" is when the credentials are compared against some
 * sort of registry or other test of authenticity.
 * <p>
 * The DSpace instance may configure many authentication methods, in a
 * "stack".  The same credentials are passed to each method in turn
 * until one accepts them, so each method need only attempt to interpret
 * and validate the credentials and fail gracefully if they are not
 * appropriate for it.  The next method in the stack is then called.
