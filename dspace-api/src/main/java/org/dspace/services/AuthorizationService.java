/**
 * AuthorizationService handles all authorization checks for DSpace. For better
 * security, DSpace assumes that you do not have the right to do something
 * unless that permission is spelled out somewhere. That "somewhere" is the
 * ResourcePolicy table. The AuthorizationService is given a user, an object, and an
 * action, and it then does a lookup in the ResourcePolicy table to see if there
 * are any policies giving the user permission to do that action.
 * <p>
 * ResourcePolicies now apply to single objects (such as submit (ADD) permission
 * to a collection.)
 * <p>
 * Note: If an eperson is a member of the administrator group (id 1), then they
 * are automatically given permission for all requests another special group is
 * group 0, which is anonymous - all Epeople are members of group 0.
