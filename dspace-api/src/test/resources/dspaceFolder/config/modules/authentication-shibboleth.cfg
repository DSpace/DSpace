# DSpace requires email as user's credential. There are 2 ways of providing
# email to DSpace:
# 1) by explicitly specifying to the user which attribute (header)
#    carries the email address.
# 2) by turning on the user-email-using-tomcat=true which means
#    the software will try to acquire the user's email from Tomcat
# The first option takes PRECEDENCE when specified. Both options can
# be enabled to allow fallback.

# this option below specifies that the email comes from the mentioned header.
# The value is CASE-Sensitive.
email-header = MAIL

# optional. Specify the header that carries user's first name
# this is going to be used for creation of new-user
firstname-header = SHIB-EP-GIVENNAME

# optional. Specify the header that carries user's last name
# this is used for creation of new user
lastname-header = SHIB-EP-SURNAME

# this option below forces the software to acquire the email from Tomcat.
email-use-tomcat-remote-user = true

# should we allow new users to be registered automtically
# if the IdP provides sufficient info (and user not exists in DSpace)
autoregister = true

# these two header here specify which attribute that is responsible
# for providing user's roles to DSpace and unscope the attributes if needed.
# When not specified, it is defaulted to 'Shib-EP-UnscopedAffiliation', and
# ignore-scope is defaulted to 'false'.
# The value is specified in AAP.xml (Shib 1.3.x) or
# attribute-filter.xml (Shib 2.x). The value is CASE-Sensitive.
# The values provided in this header are separated by semicolon or comma.
# If your sp only provides scoped role header, you need to set
# role-header.ignore-Scope as true.
# for example if you only get Shib-EP-ScopedAffiliation instead of Shib-EP-ScopedAffiliation,
# you have to  make your setting as:
# role-header = Shib-EP-ScopedAffiliation
# role-header.ignore-scope = true

# role-header = Shib-EP-UnscopedAffiliation
role-header.ignore-scope = false

# when user is fully authN on IdP but would not like to release
# his/her roles to DSpace (for privacy reasons?), what should be
# the default roles be given to such users?
# The values are separated by semicolon or comma
# default-roles = Staff, Walk-ins

# The following mappings specify role mapping between IdP and Dspace.
# the left side of the entry is IdP's role (prefixed with
# "role.") which will be mapped to
# the right entry from DSpace. DSpace's group as indicated on the
# right entry has to EXIST in DSpace, otherwise user will be identified
# as 'anonymous'. Multiple values on the right entry should be separated
# by comma. The values are CASE-Sensitive. Heuristic one-to-one mapping
# will be done when the IdP groups entry are not listed below (i.e.
# if "X" group in IdP is not specified here, then it will be mapped
# to "X" group in DSpace if it exists, otherwise it will be mapped
# to simply 'anonymous')
#
# Given sufficient demand, future release could support regex for the mapping
# special characters need to be escaped by \
role.Senior\ Researcher = Researcher, Staff
role.Librarian = Administrator
