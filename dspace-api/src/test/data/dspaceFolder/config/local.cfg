# A "local.cfg" which is used by our Unit/Integration Testing framework
#
# Any configurations added to this file will automatically OVERRIDE configurations
# of the same name in any of the DSpace *.cfg files.
#
# While some sample configurations are provided below, you may also copy
# ANY configuration from ANY DSpace *.cfg file into this "local.cfg" to OVERRIDE
# its default value. This includes any of these files:
#    * [dspace]/config/dspace.cfg
#    * Or any configuration file that is loaded into 'dspace.cfg'
#     (see "include =" settings near the end of dspace.cfg for full list)
#
# You may also specify additional configuration files to load by simply adding:
# include = [file-path]
# The [file-path] should be relative to the [dspace]/config/ folder, e.g.
# include = modules/authentication-ldap.cfg
#
# Any commented out settings in this file are simply ignored. A configuration
# will only override another configuration if it has the EXACT SAME key/name.
# For example, including "dspace.dir" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "dspace.dir" in the dspace.cfg file.

# DSpace installation directory.
# This is the location where you want to install DSpace.
# Windows note: Please remember to use forward slashes for all paths (e.g. C:/dspace)
# NOTE: COMMENTED OUT FOR TEST ENVIRONMENT, AS WE DYNAMICALLY SET THIS VIA
# A SYSTEM PROPERTY (-Ddspace.dir) in the maven-surefire-plugin configuration

# This is especially useful for development and test environments where production data is used when testing functionality.
