#---------------------IDENTIFIER CONFIGURATIONS------------------------#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------#
# These configs are used for additional identifier configuration such  #
# as the Show Identifiers step which can "pre-mint" DOIs and Handles   #
#----------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Should configured  identifiers (eg handle and DOI) be minted for (future) registration at workspace item creation?
# A handle created at this stage will act just like a regular handle created at archive time.
# A DOI created at this stage will be in a 'PENDING' status while in workspace and workflow.
# At the time of item install, the DOI filter (if any) will be applied and if the item matches the filter, the DOI
# status will be updated to TO_BE_REGISTERED. An administrator can also manually progress the DOI status, overriding
# any filters, in the item status page.
# This option doesn't require the Show Identifiers submission step to be visible.
# Default: false
identifiers.submission.register = false

# This configuration property can be set to a filter name to determine if a PENDING DOI for an item
# should be queued for registration. If the filter doesn't match, the DOI will stay in PENDING or MINTED status
# so that the identifier itself persists in case it is considered for registration in the future.
# See doi-filter and other example filters in item-filters.xml.
# Default (always_true_filter)
identifiers.submission.filter.install = doi_filter

# This optional configuration property can be set to a filter name, in case there are some initial rules to apply
# when first deciding whether a DOI should be be created for a new workspace item with a PENDING status.
# This filter is only applied if identifiers.submission.register is true.
# This filter is updated as submission data is saved.
# Default: (always_true_filter)
identifiers.submission.filter.workspace = doi_filter

# If true, the workspace filter will be applied as submission data is saved. If the filter no longer
# matches the item, the DOI will be shifted into a MINTED status and not displayed in the submission section.
# If false, then once a DOI has been created with PENDING status it will remain that way until final item install
# Default: true
#identifiers.submission.strip_pending_during_submission = true

# This configuration property can be set to a filter name to determine if an item processed by RegisterDOI curation
# task should be eligible for a DOI
identifiers.submission.filter.curation = always_true_filter

# Show Register DOI button in item status page?
# Default: false
identifiers.item-status.register-doi = true

# Which identifier types to show in submission step?
# Default: handle, doi (currently the only supported identifier 'types')
identifiers.submission.display = handle
identifiers.submission.display = doi
