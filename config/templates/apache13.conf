# This is the configuration file template for deploying DSpace under Tomcat 4.0
# and Apache 1.3.  This deploys DSpace as the "root" application - if the
# server is being used for other applications minor changes may be necessary.
# mod_ssl must be installed and enabled.  This file assumes mod_webapp (the
# connector for Tomcat/Apache) is installed.  The default Tomcat connector
# configuration is OK (Warp connector, on localhost port 8008).
# 
# Text surrounded by two '@' symbols is replaced with the corresponding
# property from dspace.cfg.  For example:
#
# @@dspace.url@@
#
# would be replaced with the dspace.url property in dspace.cfg.
# When /dspace/bin/install-configs is run, this file will be installed in the
# location specified by the property: config.template.apache13.conf
# 
# This file does most of the work - only minor changes are needed in the
# default Apache 1.3 configuration:
# 
#  - The ServerName must be set correctly
#  
#  - Any existing SSL virtual host should be removed/commented out
#  
#  - Set the User/Group and ServerAdmin properties appropriately
#
#  - Include this file!  e.g. Include /usr/local/apache/conf/dspace-httpd.conf

#### Main (port 80) HTTP Configuration

# Only access to the OAI data provider webapp is permitted.  All other
# requests are redirected to the SSL host which is the Web UI.

# To do this we match: "/"
#                      anything not starting with 'o'
#                      anything with a second letter that isn't 'a'
#                      anything with a third letter that isn't 'i'
# and redirect those to the SSL port.  Only "/oai" (or "/o" or "/oa") slip
# through this net and get the to the non-SSL server.
