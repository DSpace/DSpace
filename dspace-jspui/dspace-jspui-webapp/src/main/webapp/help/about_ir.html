<h1>About Institutional Repositories</h1>

<h2>What's so great about the institutional repository concept?</h2>

<p>Scholars and researchers generally publish their work to disseminate it to the broadest possible audience of interested
readers. The basic concept of institutional repositories is to use the power of the Internet to make research available 
and maintain permanent access to this valuable information. By providing stable storage for deposited files and gathering 
and publicizing basic descriptive information, these digital documents can be found, read, and used by a global audience.
Repositories are designed to make it easy for authors to deposit their works and for any researcher to locate works of 
interest quickly and easily. The costs are kept very low and are covered by the institution rather than the author or the
reader.

<h2>How do institutional repositories work?</h2>

<p>Many research institutions are building repositories and sharing the descriptions of their contents 
with search services. Although different institutions use different software to manage their repositories, the ability to 
exchange information seamlessly results when common standards for sharing information are used. DRUM uses software that
presents descriptive information on its stored files in standard formats so that it is understandable to a wide variety 
of search services. <br>

DRUM also provides a permanent URL for each deposit. This ensures that access to files is maintained over time as there
is a stable, standard reference for each deposit. Even though software will be upgraded and the repository will be moved 
to new computers over time, the permanent URLs will continue to point correctly to each deposit.

<h2>How do people find items in institutional repositories?</h2>

<p>Someone looking for information on a particular topic does not have to know the information is in DRUM. 
He or she simply uses a search engine, finds a hit for a DRUM item, and accesses it. On the other hand, someone wishing to 
see what research has been going on in a particular department or what documents have been deposited by a particular 
researcher can come to DRUM and browse through the repository.</p>

<h2>What other universities are building institutional repositories?</h2>

<p>Institutional repositories are developing rapidly on university campuses across the country and around 
the world. Some pioneers of the concept include MIT and the University of California System. Many other institutions are 
building their repositories on the same timeline as the University of Maryland.</p>
