<a name="find"><h2>How to find a scholarly work in DRUM</h2></a>

<p>DRUM allows you to search or browse the entire repository or to browse or search individual communities and collections 
within the repository.</p>

<p>To search or browse the entire repository, use the search and browse functions available in the upper left corner 
of DRUM's <a href="../">home page</a>. Details on how the search and browse functions work are available from DRUM's 
<a href="index.html#browse">help page</a>.</p>

<p>To search or browse a collection or a group of collections forming a community, first go to the home page for the 
collection or community. From the home page, select the community you are interested in. To access a collection, 
use the link from the community's page. Each community and collection home page has a search box with additional buttons below it to help you browse by author, title, and date </p>

<a name="when"><h2>How to determine when a work was deposited in DRUM</h2></a>

<p>All DRUM deposits have up three time/date stamps included in the descriptive information for each deposit. If something 
was previously published, an issue date appears in the standard view of the descriptive information (the screen that 
includes the link to the work at the bottom) indicating the original date of publication. 
If you use the "Show full item record" link at the bottom of the page, two additional date/time stamps are listed: date 
accessioned and date available. These are usually identical and indicate when the work was deposited into DRUM.</p>

to the deposited file. The permanent URL is given in a gray box at the top of the page.</p>

<a name="link"><h2>How to build a link that points directly to a particular collection</h2></a>

<p>Permanent URLs are created for all collection and community home pages within DRUM. When you are at a collection or community home page (the page with the search box), the permanent URL is displayed in the gray box at the top of the page.</p>
