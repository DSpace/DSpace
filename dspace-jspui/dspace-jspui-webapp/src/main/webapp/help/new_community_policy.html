<h1>Policy for Creating DRUM Communities</h1>

<ul>
  	<li>Any current UM faculty member can request the creation of a new community.</li>
	<li>Proposals for new communities will be reviewed by the UM Libraries in conjunction with other stakeholders 
	as appropriate.</li>
	<li>New communities will be managed by the requestor although the Libraries reserve the right to impose added 
	review by the Libraries to assist in repository management.</li>
	<li>New communities must meet needs beyond those served by existing communities.</li>
	<li>Submission to all communities and their collections must be limited to works or collections authored by 
	University of Maryland affiliates.</li>
	<li>Submitters to all collections must have the ability to assign needed rights to the University of Maryland.</li>
	<li>All works in collections must be substantive works of scholarship.</li>
	<li>All submissions must be complete - able to stand alone as a work or collection.</li>
	<li>All collections will be distributed freely across the web (access will not be limited by location).</li>
</ul>
