<h1>About DRUM</h1>

<h2>What is DRUM?</h2>

<p>DRUM is the Digital Repository at the University of Maryland. Currently, there are three types of materials in our collections: faculty-deposited documents, a Library-managed collection of UM theses and dissertations, and collections of technical reports.<p>

<p>As a digital repository, files are maintained on DRUM for the long term. Descriptive information on the deposited works is distributed freely to search engines. Unlike the Web, where pages come and go and addresses to resources can change overnight, repository items have a permanent URL and the institution is committed to maintaining the service into the future.</p>

<h2>Who manages DRUM?</h2>

<p>The University of Maryland Libraries manage both the software and hardware for DRUM as a service to the campus. The Libraries are also working to ensure that the submission process is 
simple and error free. Staff at the Libraries check files at the time of deposit to make sure that file 
submission was successful and to check for obvious errors in the submission process. No review of content is 
performed.</p>

<h2>How does DRUM work?</h2>

<p>DRUM uses <a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace software</a>, jointly developed by MIT and Hewlett Packard. 
Further development of DSpace is now being managed by the DSpace Foundation.</p>

<p>DRUM allows registered users to submit files and accompanying descriptions of the work. The software is 
designed to support long-term maintenance of the files. It uses standard procedures to offer the descriptive 
data to search engines, along with a permanent URL for the work. DRUM allows any Web user to access the repository 
contents.</p>

<p>DRUM also offers the capability of creating specialized communities. Communities can be used to group related 
materials, to peer review submissions, or eventually to create virtual publications. Please <a href="mailto:drum-help@umd.edu">contact us</a> for more 
information on creating communities in DRUM.</p>
