<h1>DRUM Distribution License</h1>

<p><strong>The text of the agreement:</strong></p>

<p>By signing and submitting this agreement, I grant the University of Maryland a 
no cost, nonexclusive, right and license to include the scholarly material identified below 
in the Digital Repository at the University of Maryland ("DRUM"), and to reproduce, 
translate and distribute the material world-wide in any format and in any medium 
provided the University does not alter the content of the material.   I also agree that the 
University of Maryland may make and retain more than one copy of the material 
submitted as it deems necessary for purposes of security, preservation and back up.</p>

<p>I understand that if I wish to publish the material with a third party that requires 
exclusive publication rights, I may direct the University to remove the material from 
DRUM.  In such an event, I understand that the bibliographic reference to the material 
will be retained in DRUM, but the material will be removed to a "dark archive" where it 
is no longer publicly available.</p>

<p>I represent that I  am the sole or joint owner of copyright in the material and to 
the extent that I do not hold copyright in all or part of the material that I have the 
written authority from the owner of copyright to grant this license to the University of 
Maryland.  If the material is based on work that was sponsored or supported by an 
agency or entity other than the University of Maryland, I represent that I have respected 
any right of review or other obligations the sponsor required, including an obligation to 
acknowledge its support in connection with any publication of the material.</p> 

<p>This agreement will be interpreted and governed in accordance with applicable Federal 
law and the laws of the State of Maryland. </p>
