<h1>The Guide to Submitting Items into DRUM</h1>

<p>DRUM is a service of the University of Maryland Libraries. The University of Maryland Libraries use DRUM 
as a long-term storage system for digital documents; it captures, preserves, and provides access to the research 
output of University of Maryland researchers, centers, and labs.
</p>

<p>This document gives a brief overview of how DRUM works. It is oriented to help anyone get started submitting 
for deposit to DRUM quickly. Because DRUM is not your run-of-the-mill content	management system, we hope you'll 
review the concepts presented	here, and that doing so will help you prepare and submit your files more smoothly.
</p>

<p>On to the overview! First, two meta-points:</p>

	<ol>
  		<li>This is a very simplified overview of DRUM; there is much more
			extensive documentation available within DRUM itself
			and elsewhere, some of which is referenced in this document. If
			you don't see what you need to know, don't hesitate to <a href="#help">contact
			us</a>.</li>
  		<li>This guide is geared toward those who intend to deposit a
			small number (one, or a handful, but not thousands!) of files
			for storage in DRUM. This would apply to you if you want to
			store an article, or some images, or code, or if you're in a
			position where you might be regularly asked to deposit an article
			or working paper on behalf of others, but not necessarily many
			at once. We've developed a Web interface for uploading content
			which we think you'll find straightforward for occasional or
			regular uploads, but we have other tools for loading a large
			bulk of content at once. If you have a large collection of
			digital materials you'd like to deposit into DRUM, please contact
			us directly and we can discuss what the best approach for you
			might be.</li>
	</ol>

<h2>What you need to know about depositing works in DRUM</h2>

<h3>The Submission Process</h3>

<p>You will need to be logged in to DRUM before you can begin a deposit. See the <a href="submit_policy.jsp">
deposit policy</a> for who can submit works. University of Maryland users can log in using their university ID and password. The system automatically assigns 
you deposit permissions based	on the departmental information found in the University LDAP system, which manages 
personal information about campus affiliates.
</p>

<p>After starting a submission, you will be led through a seven-step process: this includes some basic questions about 
your materials first, then several screens where you can describe your materials (see <a href="#metadata">metadata</a> 
below) and upload your files, a verification screen (where you can even compare file checksums if you wish), and a 
license-granting screen. Each of these steps has more detailed documentation available as links on each screen.
</p>

<p>After you finish, the folks at the UM Libraries will look over your submission to make sure that it appears 
complete and then will approve your deposit. In other words, your materials will not go directly into the archive. 
You will be notified by email as soon as final approval of your submission occurs.
</p>

<h3>On the Organization of DRUM</h3>

<p>DRUM content is organized into communities, with logical	groups of materials organized into collections within 
individual communities. The smallest unit of content in DRUM is an "item," a.k.a., one "thing," whether that's a 
single file article, or a single dataset made of several files, or several file format versions of the same image. 
Take a look at the <a href="../community-list">communities overview</a> and browse some 
DRUM items to get a feel for how it works. If you have questions about whether your materials should be one or 
several items, or even a collection, feel free to contact us and we'll be happy to consult with you.
</p>

<a name="metadata"><h3>On Metadata in DRUM</h3></a>

<p>We librarians are big on metadata. Hopefully after thinking about it a bit you will be too. In collections as big as 
libraries, of which DRUM is just a part, being able to find a single item or a set of relevant items for a given user 
in some context of information need is very dependent on the quality and consistency of descriptive information available 
for querying. Some description can be done mechanically: file sizes, checksums, and full-text indexing, for instance, 
are critical elements, so we've built those in. But we also need a higher order of human-made description in order to determine 
things like titles, authors, unique identifiers, and abstracts. If DRUM handled just one genre of content (say, just 
articles), we could standardize formats and templates to make this easier. DRUM handles many genres and many formats, 
however, so we need your help in providing this description.
</p>

<p>DRUM uses a qualified version of Dublin Core as a descriptive lingua franca across all content. Some communities or 
collections may also have tailored metadata available (such as MARC records for book collections or FGDC records for 
geographic datasets). But even where that's available for some items, we crosswalk more detailed metadata records into 
our Dublin Core vocabulary to ensure a common layer of descriptive specificity for browsing and searching across 
everything. The "describe" pages in the submission interface map the values you enter to our vocabulary: what you enter 
will be what others use to find your content in the future. So please take a moment to read the explanations of each 
field and check the help screens. And don't hesitate to <a href="#help">contact us</a> with questions, comments, or 
concerns!
</p>

<a name="formats"><h3>On File Formats</h3></a>

<p>Over time, items stored in DRUM will be preserved using a combination of time-honored techniques for data management 
and best practices for digital preservation. As for specific file formats, however, obsolescence and proprietary formats 
make it impossible to guarantee the exact same level of preservation support services for every file.
</p>

<p>We have drafted an initial format support policy. As DRUM develops, we will be working to create a more complete policy 
that we believe will balance the needs of most researchers with the long-term reality and costs of supporting changing 
technologies over time. Put simply, our initial policy for file formats is:
</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>everything put into DRUM will be retrievable</li>
  		<li>we will recognize as many file formats as
			possible</li>
  		<li>we will support as many known file formats as
			possible</li>
	</ul>

<a name="access"><h3>Access Controls</h3></a>

<p>DRUM implements very minimal access controls. Access controls can be used to ensure that items requiring usage 
restrictions will be properly limited. In the future, some collections may be limited to University of Maryland 
network access only, for instance. Currently, all DRUM materials are made freely available to anyone in the world. 
This includes all items submitted to the collections for individual deposit by UM faculty.
</p>

<a name="rights"><h3>Author Rights and Rights Transfer to the University of Maryland</h3></a>

<p>The University of Maryland needs some rights to be granted by authors so that their works can be maintained in the repository. As an author, you never have to give another organization ALL of your copyrights for them to legally store and maintain your work. Recognizing that the University of Maryland needs to have authors approve a minimum level of rights transfer, the agreement used by DRUM only asks for non-exclusive rights to keep the work, preserve it, and make it available on the Web. The term "non-exclusive" means that when you deposit a work in DRUM, you retain all of the copyrights to your work. You can sign other agreements with other organizations granting them the rights you have retained or you can use and enforce those rights yourself. Authors often have many questions about their copyrights for their works and how copyright issues affect their ability to deposit work in DRUM. More information 
is available about <a href="author_rights.jsp">your rights as an author</a> and about giving non-exclusive rights to the 
University of Maryland. There is a also a set of <a href="FAQs.jsp#authorfaq">Author FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>If you are at all unsure about whether you have permission to deposit a particular item in DRUM, don't do it! Get 
in touch with us and we'll help figure it out what will be best.
