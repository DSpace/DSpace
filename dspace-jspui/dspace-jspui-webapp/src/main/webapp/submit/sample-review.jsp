                                A <strong>review JSP</strong> creates the <em>review section</em> for a single Step
								in the submission process.  In this case, this <em>review section</em> is for the Sample Step.
                                A review JSP should consist of a single table, which contains two main columns:
								</p>
								<ul>
								<li>The left column (this column) should contain all of the information which was gathered 
							    from this step (or at least anything that a user may want to review).</li>
								<li>The right column should contain a submit button (see the "Correct one of these" button to the right->) which will jump the user back to this Step
							    in the submission process.</li>
								</ul>
							    <p>
                                To see sample code, please visit the JSP which built this review section.
							    This JSP is located at <em>/jsp/submit/sample-review.jsp</em>
