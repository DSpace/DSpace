  - Cancel or save submission page
  -
  - This page is displayed whenever the user clicks "cancel" during a
  - submission.  It asks them whether they want to delete the incomplete
  - item or leave it so they can continue later.
  -
  - Attributes to pass in:
  -    submission.info  - the SubmissionInfo object
  -    step             - the step the user was at when the cancelled
  -                       (as a String)
  -    display.step -   - this is the step to display in the progress bar
  -                       (i.e. the step from the user's perspective, rather
  -                       than the exact JSP the user clicked cancel on)
