    <%-- <p>There was an inconsistency in the data received from your browser.
    This may be due to one of several things:</p> --%>

    <ul>
        <%-- <li>Sometimes, if you used your browser's "back" button during an operation like a
        submission, clicking on a button may try and do something that's already
        been done, such as commit the submission to the archive.
        Clicking your browsers "reload" or "refresh" button may have similar
        results.</li> --%>
        <li><fmt:message key="jsp.error.integrity.list1"/></li>
        <%-- <li>If you got here by following a link or bookmark provided by someone
        else, the link may be incorrect or you mistyped the link.  Please check
        the link and try again.</li> --%>
        <li><fmt:message key="jsp.error.integrity.list2"/></li>
        <%-- <li>If you have more than one browser window open with DSpace, this can cause
        a similar problem whereby a button clicked in one window may make a button
        click in the other window invalid.</li> --%>
        <li><fmt:message key="jsp.error.integrity.list3"/></li>
        <%-- <li>Of course, you may have uncovered a problem with the system!  All of
        these errors are logged, and we'll be checking them regularly to see
        if there is a problem.</li> --%>
