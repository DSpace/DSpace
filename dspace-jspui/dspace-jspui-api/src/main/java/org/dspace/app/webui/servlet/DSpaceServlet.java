 * also grabs the original request URL for later use.
 * <P>
 * Unlike regular servlets, DSpace servlets should override the
 * <code>doDSGet</code> and <code>doDSPost</code> methods, which provide a
 * DSpace context to work with, and handle the common exceptions
 * <code>SQLException</code> and <code>AuthorizeException</code>.
 * <code>doGet</code> and <code>doPost</code> should be overridden only in
 * special circumstances.
 * <P>
 * Note that if all goes well, the context object passed in to
 * <code>doDSGet</code> and <code>doDSPut</code> must be completed
 * <em>after</em> a JSP has been displayed, but <code>before</code> the
 * method returns. If an error occurs (an exception is thrown, or the context is
 * not completed) the context is aborted after <code>doDSGet</code> or
 * <code>doDSPut</code> return.
