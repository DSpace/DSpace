/**
 * Tag for producing a popup window link. Takes advantage of Javascript to
 * produce a small window that is brought to the front every time a popup link
 * is pressed. If Javascript is not available, a simple HTML link is used as a
 * fallback. The contents of the tag are used as the text of the link.
 * 
 * Additionally, this will link to the "local" version of the URL, if a locally
 * modified version exists.
 * 
 * FIXME: Currently supports a single popup window at a hardcoded size; extra
 * attributes could be added at a later date (e.g. name, width, height)
