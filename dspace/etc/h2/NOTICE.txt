DSpace does NOT support the use of the H2 Database (http://www.h2database.com/)
in Production. Instead, DSpace uses the H2 Database to perform Unit Testing
during development.

By default, the DSpace Unit Testing environment configures H2 to run in "Oracle
Mode" and initializes the H2 database using the Oracle schema (at
../oracle/database_schema.sql). In the future, if we find the Oracle schema is
unable to work for H2, we may need to (re)create an H2-specific database_schema.sql.
