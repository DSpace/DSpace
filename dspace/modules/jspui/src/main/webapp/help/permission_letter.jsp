<h1>Text for a Letter Requesting Permission for DRUM Deposit</h1>

<p>Dear [Permissions Manager]:</p>

<p>I am writing to request permission to archive a final version of my manuscript for the article:</p>

<p align="center">[Article Citation]</p>

<p>As author of this work, I transferred my rights to this work to [Publisher] and hence am requesting permission for 
electronic deposit of the work in the Digital Repository at the University of Maryland (DRUM) located at drum.lib.umd.edu. Depositing an electronic copy 
of the final manuscript in my institution's digital repository would ensure digital preservation of the intellectual 
property I created and allow broader access to my work. When depositing the final version of the manuscript, I will 
provide full citation to the original publication.<p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration of this request. If you have questions or concerns about this request, please feel free to contact me by phone [phone number] or email 
[address].</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
