<p>DRUM captures, distributes, and preserves University of Maryland's digital research
products. Here you can find articles, working papers, preprints,
technical reports, conference papers, and data sets in various digital
formats. Our content grows daily as new communities and collections are
added to DRUM.</p>

<p>The DRUM content is organized around communities which correspond to University of
Maryland administrative entities, such as colleges, schools, and
departments. Within each community there can be an unlimited number of
collections. Within each collection there can be an unlimited number of
items.</p>

<hr>

<a name="browse"><h2>Browse</h2></a>

<p><strong>Browse</strong> allows you to go through a list of items in some specified order:</p>

	<p><strong>Browse by Community/Collection</strong> takes you through the communities in
	alphabetical order and allows you to see the collections within each community.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Browse by Date </strong>allows you to move through a list of all items in DRUM in reverse
	chronological order.</p>

	<p><strong>Browse by Author</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all
	authors of items in DRUM.</p>

	<p><strong>Browse by Title</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all titles of items
	in DRUM.</p>

	<p><strong>Browse by Subject</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all subject terms in DRUM.</p>



<p><strong>You may sign on to DRUM if you:</strong></p>

	<ul>
 		<li>wish to subscribe to a collection and receive e-mail updates when new items are added</li>
  		<li>wish to go to the "My DRUM" page that tracks your subscriptions and other interactions with DRUM requiring authorization (if you are a submitter for a collection, for instance)</li>
  		<li>wish to edit your profile</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>Submit</strong> is the DRUM function that enables University of Maryland faculty to add an
item to DRUM. The submission process includes filling out information about the item on a metadata form and uploading the file(s)
comprising the digital item.</p>

<p><strong>My DRUM</strong> is a personal page that is maintained for each member. This page can
contain a list of items that are in the submission process for a
particular member or a task list of items that need attention, such as
editing, reviewing, or checking.</p>

<p><strong>Edit Profile</strong> allows you to change your password (if you are a non-UM user).</p>

<p><strong>About</strong> DRUM takes you to information about DRUM and its development.</p>

<hr>

<a name="search"><h2>Search</h2></a>

<p>To search all of DRUM, use the yellow search box at the top of the navigation bar on the
left.</p>

<p>To limit your search to a specific community or collection, navigate to that
community or collection and use the search bar on that page.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="searchother.gif" width="253" height="69"></p>

<p>Here are some search hints:</p>

<blockquote>
  	<p><strong>What is searched in the general keyword search (yellow box)</strong><br>
  	The word(s) you enter in the search box will be searched against
	the title, author, subject abstract, series, sponsor, and identifier
	fields of each item's record. </p>
  	
	<p><strong>What is not searched: Stop Words</strong><br>
  	The search engine ignores certain words that occur frequently in English 
	but that do not add value to the search. These are: </p>
  	
		<blockquote>"a," "and," "are," "as," "at," "be," "but," "by," "for," "if," 
				"in," "into," "is," "it," "no," "not," "of," "on," "or," "such," "the," "to," "was"
		</blockquote>
  
	<p><strong>Truncation</strong><br>
	Use an asterisk (*) after a word stem to retrieve all words starting with that root. For example: </p>
 
		<blockquote>
    			<img src="search1.gif" width="75" height="27"> will retrieve selects,
			 selector, selecting.
  		</blockquote>
  
	<p><strong>Stemming</strong><br>
	The search engine automatically expands words with common endings to include plurals, past tenses, etc.</p>
  
	<p><strong>Phrase Searching</strong><br>
	To search using multiple words as a phrase, put quotation marks (") around the phrase.</p>
  	
		<blockquote>
			<img src="search8.jpg" width="196" height="28">
		</blockquote>

  	<p><strong>Exact word match</strong><br>
	Put a plus (+) sign before a word if it MUST appear in the search result. For instance, in the following 
	search, the word "training" is optional but the word "dog" must be in the result. </p>
  
		<blockquote>
    			<img src="search2.gif" width="123" height="27">
  		</blockquote>

	<p><strong>Eliminate items with unwanted words</strong><br>
	Put a minus (-) sign before a word if it should not appear in the search results. Alternatively, you can use 
	<strong>NOT</strong>. This can limit your search to eliminate unwanted hits. For instance, in the search</p>
 		
		<blockquote>
			<img src="search3.jpg" width="124" height="28"> or <img src="search4.jpg" width="136" height="28">
		</blockquote>
  	
	<p>you will get items containing the word "training," except those that also contain the word "cat."</p>

	<p><strong>Boolean searching</strong><br>
	The following Boolean operators can be used to combine terms. Note that they must be CAPITALIZED!</p>
 
	<p><strong>AND</strong> - to limit searches to find items containing all words or phrases combined with this operator.</p>
  
		<blockquote>
    			<img src="search5.jpg" width="124" height="28"> will retrieve all items that contain BOTH the words 
			"cats" and "dogs."
		</blockquote>
  
	<p><strong>OR</strong> - to enlarge searches to find items containing any of the words or phrases surrounding this operator.</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<img src="search6.jpg" width="124" height="28"> will retrieve all items that contain EITHER the words
			 "cats" or "dogs."
		</blockquote>

	<p><strong>NOT</strong> - to exclude items containing the word following this operator.</p>

		<blockquote>
    			<img src="search4.jpg" width="136" height="28">will retrieve all items that contain the word "training"
			 EXCEPT those also containing the word "cat."
  		</blockquote>

	<p><strong>Parentheses</strong> - to group search terms into sets. Operators can then be applied to the whole set.</p>
  
		<blockquote>
			<img src="search7.jpg" width="340" height="28">
		</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<a name="communities"><h2>Communities</h2></a>
 
<p>DRUM content is organized around communities which correspond to University of Maryland administrative entities 
such as colleges, schools, and departments. Within each community there can be an unlimited number of collections. Within 
each collection there can be an unlimited number of items.</p>

<p>Initially, the available communities for direct faculty submission all correspond to the administrative structure of the
 University of Maryland. More specialized communities and collections can be accommodated; for instance, look at the 
community called &quot;Tech Reports in Computer Science and Engineering.&quot; DRUM has the flexibility to accommodate the 
differing needs of the campus by allowing the creation of communities that</p>

<ul>
	<li>vary in their policies, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>who contributes content</li>
			<li>whether there will be a review process</li>
    			<li>who will have access, and</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>vary in their workflow, i.e., reviewing, editing, metadata</li>
</ul>

<p>Each community has its own entry page displaying information, news, and links reflecting the interests of that 
community, as well as a descriptive list of collections within the community.</p>

<hr>

<a name="collections"><h2>Collections</h2></a>

<p>Communities can maintain an unlimited number of collections in DRUM. Special collections 
can be organized around a topic, by type of information (such as working papers or datasets), or by any other 
sorting method a community finds useful in organizing its digital items. Collections can have different policies and 
workflows. Take a look at the community called "Tech Reports in Computer Science and Engineering" to see a different 
type of collection.</p>

<p>Each DRUM collection has its own entry page displaying information, news, and links reflecting the interests of 
users of that collection.</p>

<p><strong>Subject/Keywords:</strong></p>

<p> Please enter as many subject keywords as are appropriate to describe this item, from the general to the specific. 
The more words you provide, the more likely it is that users will find this item in their searches. Use one input box 
for each subject word or phrase. You can get more input boxes by clicking on the "Add More" button. Examples:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="keywords.gif" width="533" height="100"></p>

<p><strong><a name="upload">Upload a File</a></strong></p>

<p>Click on the "Browse" button and a window showing your files will appear. You can navigate through your directories and folders until you find the correct file to upload. Double-click on the file name you wish to upload and the name will be entered into the input box.</p>

<p>Once the correct file name is in the input box, click on the "Next" button to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="filedescription"><strong>Uploading More Than One File</strong></a></p>

<p>If you specified at the beginning of the submit process that you had more than one file to upload for this item, you 
will see an input box marked "<strong>File Description</strong>." The information you provide here will help users to understand 
what information is in each file, for instance, "main article" or "images" or "computer program" or "data set." Enter 
file descriptions for each item and click on the "Next" button to proceed.</p>

<hr>

<a name="formats"><h2>File Formats</h2></a>

<p>To properly archive and give access to a file, we need to know what <em>format</em> it is, for example, "PDF," "HTML," 
or "Microsoft Word." If the system does not automatically recognize the format of the file you have uploaded, you will 
be asked to describe it. If the format of the file appears in the list offered, click on it and then on "Submit." If 
you can't see the format in the list, click on "Format Not in List" and describe the format in the text box lower down 
on the page. Be sure to give the name of the application you used to create the file and the version of that application, 
for example, "Autodesk AutoCAD R20 for UNIX."</p>

<p><strong><a name="uploadedfile">Uploaded File</a></strong></p>

<p>After you have uploaded a file, check the information in the table to make sure it is correct. There are two further 
ways to verify that your files have been uploaded correctly:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Click on the filename. This will download the file in a new browser window so that you can check the contents.</li>
		<li>Compare the <a href="#checksum">file checksum</a> displayed here with the checksum you calculate.</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>If you're only uploading one file</strong>, click on "Next" when you're satisfied that the file has been uploaded correctly.</p>

<p><strong>If you're uploading more than one file</strong>, click on the "Add Another File" button. When you are satisfied that all 
files for this item have been successfully uploaded, click on the "Next" button.</p>

<p><strong><a name="checksum">Checksums</a></strong></p>

<p>DRUM generates an MD5 checksum for every file it stores. We use this checksum internally to verify the integrity of 
files over time (a file's checksum shouldn't change). You can use this checksum to be sure what we've received is indeed 
the file you've uploaded.</p>

<p>To do this, click "Show checksums" on the "Uploaded File" page. The DRUM-generated MD5 checksum for every file we've 
received from you will show to the right of the filename.</p>

<p>You will need to use a local program to generate your own checksum for these files and to verify that your results match 
ours. On most UNIX-like systems (including Athena and Mac OS X), use md5sum. For instance, type "md5sum MYFILE" for every 
file you want to check. The summary should print on your screen.</p>

<p>For Windows machines, MD5 tools are freely available: try md5 (from <a  href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">
http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/</a>), or md5sum, available via the textutils package in Cygwin (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>).</p>

<p>All of these utilities will need to be run from a command-line, or terminal, window. The entire digest that prints out 
when you run the md5 tool on the local copy of the file you're uploading should be exactly equal to what DRUM reports.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="verify"><strong>Verify Submission</strong></a></p>

<p>This page lets you review the information you have entered to describe the item. To correct or edit information, click 
on the corresponding button on the right, or use the oval buttons in the progress bar at the top of the page to move 
around the submission pages. When you are satisfied that the submission is in order, click on the "Next" button to continue.</p>

<p>Click on the "Cancel/Save" button to stop and save your data or to cancel your submission.</p>

process to check that the submission is complete. You will receive email notification as soon as your item has become a

<p><a name="handle"><strong>Handle - Persistent Identifier</strong></a></p>

<p>When your item becomes a part of the DRUM repository, it is assigned a persistent URL. This means that unlike most 
URLs, this identifier will not have to be changed when the system migrates to new hardware or when changes are made 
to the system. DRUM (through the University of Maryland Libraries) is committed to maintaining the integrity of this 
identifier so that you can safely use it to refer to your item when citing it in publications or other communications. 
Our persistent URLs are registered with the <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handle System</a>, a comprehensive 
system for assigning, managing, and resolving persistent identifiers, known as "handles," for digital objects and 
other resources on the Internet. The Handle System is administered by the <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/">
Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)</a>, which undertakes, fosters, and promotes research in the 
public interest.</p>
