<h1>SCOPE OF DRUM CONTENT</h1>

<p>DRUM currently collects three main types of content. These
  include master's theses and doctoral dissertations produced by
  University of Maryland (UMD) graduate students, unpublished or
  informally- published research, and formally-published scholarship.
<p>
<h2>Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs)</h2>

<p>
  At UMD, electronic submission of theses and dissertations has been
  mandatory since the fall semester of 2003. Students submit their
  documents to the (<a
    href="http://www.gradschool.umd.edu/current_students/electronic_thesis_and_dissertations_at_um.html">Graduate
    School</a>) and after approval they are automatically deposited and
  archived in DRUM.
</p>

<p>Access to an electronic dissertation or thesis will sometimes be
  restricted in DRUM at the request of the author (this is called an
  "embargo""). The most common reasons are because the author intends to
  publish the dissertation or because the dissertation supports a patent
  application. In these cases, a record with descriptive information and
  a full abstract will still be accessible in DRUM but access to the
  full text will be delayed until the embargo period has elapsed.</p>

<h2>Informally-Published or Unpublished UMD Research</h2>

<p>Submissions may include, but are not limited to, technical
  reports, working papers, white papers, and conference presentations
  from various academic departments, research centers, and organizations
  affiliated with UMD along with undergraduate research from various
  honors programs. As defined, this "gray"" literature is not published
  commercially or readily accessible elsewhere and DRUM provides wider
  distribution of this often under-recognized research.</p>

<h2>Formally-Published UMD Faculty Research</h2>

<p>Depending on the author's agreement with the publisher, this
  includes peer-reviewed articles (pre- or post-publication) published
  in traditional journals, monographs, book chapters, or research made
  publicly available elsewhere. As an open access repository, DRUM
  provides wider dissemination of the work, which increases the
  potential for publications to be cited by others. In addition, DRUM
  accepts research created prior to appointment at Maryland and
  associated content (datasets, statistics, images, video/audio files,
  etc.) can be uploaded with any article.</p>
