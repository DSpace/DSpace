<h1>DRUM Deposit Policies</h1>

<h2>Deposit Criteria for the Individual Deposit Collections for UM Faculty:</h2>

	<ul>
  		<li>Depositor must be a University of Maryland faculty member</li>
  		<li>Depositor must have the ability to assign needed rights to UM (no deposits on behalf of 
		another, no deposit of works restricted under existing copyright agreements, etc.). Individuals who
		coauthor a work generally have the ability to assign rights for the work, unless those rights have 
		been transferred to another entity.</li>
  		<li>Deposits must be substantive works of scholarship</li>
	  	<li>Deposits must be complete - able to stand alone as a work or collection. (No notes, etc.)</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Depositors of works should note:</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The repository currently accepts works of scholarship. Course-related works (syllabi, course 
		notes, etc.) are not appropriate for deposit.</li>
		<li>All deposits will be distributed freely across the web (access will not be limited by location).</li>
  		<li>As a repository, deposited files will be maintained indefinitely, at least at the minimal level 
		of maintaining file integrity. However, migration to preserve functionality is not guaranteed. If the 
		work is of a transitory nature or of transitory usefulness,	deposit may not be appropriate.</li>
  		<li>Deposits will be reviewed by library staff for basic accuracy of metadata, fulfillment of the 
		deposit criteria,	successful attachment of file, etc.</li>
  		<li>Deposits that do not meet these criteria can be removed from the archive without notice to the 
		depositor.</li>
	</ul>
