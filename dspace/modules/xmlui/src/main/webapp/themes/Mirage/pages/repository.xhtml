          <li>Fits into the manuscript submission workflow of its partner journals, making 
          data submission <strong>easy</strong>.</li>
          <li>Gives journals the option of making data privately available during <strong>peer

          <li>Data are <strong>linked</strong> both to and from the corresponding publication
           and, where appropriate, to and from select specialized data repositories (e.g. GenBank).</li>
          <li>Assigns data Digital Object Identifiers (<strong>DOIs</strong>) to data so that 
          researchers can gain professional credit through <strong>data citation</strong>.</li>
          <li>Promotes data visibility by allowing content to be <strong>indexed</strong>, 
          <strong>searched</strong> and <strong>retrieved</strong> through interfaces designed 
          for both humans and computers.</li>

	<li>Dryad supports multiple ways of receiving article or manuscript metadata from publishers. The simplest method involves reading email notifications, but we are also implementing a <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.datadryad.org/Journal_Metadata#Metadata_Submission_via_API">REST API</a> for those desiring greater control over the data deposition process.</li>

    <h1 class="ds-div-head">Accessibility statement</h1>
    <div class="ds-static-div primary">
      <p>Dryadâ€™s <strong>vision</strong> is to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge. Our <strong>mission</strong> is to provide the infrastructure for, and promote the re-use of, data underlying the scholarly literature.</p>
	  <p>We believe that universal design and
      adherence to coding standards are the best means to ensure access to the
      broadest possible audience, and our design and development staff work together
      to achieve those goals.</p>
      <h3>DSpace internationalization</h3>
      <p>The DSpace repository software used by Dryad has built-in internationalization (i18n). This 
      feature automatically translates DSpace text based on the default language of the web browser.  
      Some customized parts of the Dryad website are only available in English at this time.</p>
      <h3>Section 508 compliance</h3>
      <p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a United States federal law, 
      while also being recognized as an international best practice. To ensure that we meet or exceed the requirements of 
      Section 508, Dryad continually reviews our site and modifies pages to remove accessibility problems for people with
      disabilities.</p> 
	  <p>Our website uses HTML that follows Section 508 standards; for
      example, we include alternate text to describe graphics. We use accessibility
      testing tools to help us find and fix issues whenever we add new features of
      content.</p>
	  <p>For more detailed information on the 508 compliance status of the
      Dryad website, please see our Voluntary Product Accessibility Template&#174; 
      (<a href="/themes/Mirage/docs/Dryad-VPAT.pdf">Dryad-VPAT.PDF</a> <img alt=" (opens in a new application)" src="/themes/Mirage/images/external-link.png" />).

      <h3>Accessibility of Dryad contents</h3>
      <p>The Dryad Repository does not impose any file format restrictions. As a result,
      Dryad cannot guarantee that all files in all data packages are accessible.
      However, we encourage authors to submit data in formats such as ASCII and HTML
      that are not only accessible to screen reading software, but also more suitable
      for preservation and reuse.</p>
      <h3>What to do if you have a problem</h3>
      <p>If you have a problem accessing any information on the Dryad website, please contact
      <a href="mailto:help@datadryad.org">help@datadryad.org</a> and we will work to
      resolve the problem.</p>
