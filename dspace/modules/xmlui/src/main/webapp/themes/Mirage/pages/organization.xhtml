   <h1 class="ds-div-head">Overview</h1>
   <div class="ds-static-div primary">    
    <p>The <strong>Dryad Digital Repository</strong> is a <strong>curated</strong> resource that makes
    the data underlying scientific publications <strong>discoverable</strong>, <strong>freely
    reusable</strong>, and <strong>citable</strong>.  Dryad provides a <strong>general-purpose</strong>
    home for a wide diversity of datatypes.</p>
    <p>Dryad is governed by a <strong>nonprofit membership organization</strong>. Membership is open to
    any stakeholder organization, including but not limited to journals, scientific societies,
    publishers, research institutions, libraries, and funding organizations.</p>
    <p>Publishers are encouraged to facilitate data archiving by coordinating the submission of
    manuscripts with submission of data to Dryad.  Learn more <a
    href="/pages/journalIntegration">here</a></p>
    <p>Dryad originated from an initiative among a group of leading journals and scientific societies in
    evolutionary biology and ecology to adopt a joint data archiving policy (JDAP) for their
    publications, and the recognition that easy-to-use, sustainable, community-governed data
    infrastructure was needed to support such a policy.  See <a href="/pages/jdap">this page</a> 
    to learn more about JDAP.</p>

    <p>Data are the foundation of the scientific enterprise.  By preserving and making available the
    data underlying the scientific and medical literature, Dryad provides benefits both to individual
    researchers, educators and students and to a diversity of stakeholder organizations.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Researchers:</strong></em> Dryad benefits researchers by providing free access to data 
    they can use for a host of different purposes: to study and validate published results, for methodology 
    development, for meta-analyses, and to address novel questions using historic observations.  Depositing
    in Dryad helps researchers get more credit for their work by increasing the usability and citability of 
    their data.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Educators and students:</strong></em> Dryad provides educators and students with the
    opportunity to teach and learn a broad array of analysis techniques, and general data literacy
    skills, using both classic and recently published research data.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Scientific societies:</strong></em> Archiving data in Dryad strengthens the legacy of
    a scientific society by permanently preserving the data and increasing the research impact of its
    members and community.  The availability of data creates new opportunities for research and
    education and promotes public trust in science.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Journals and publishers:</strong></em> Dryad frees journals and publishers from the
    responsibility and costs of publishing and maintaining supplemental data in perpetuity.  By
    encouraging a broader range of reuse, journals and publishers will increase the impact, citations
    and the prestige of their publications.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Research institutes and libraries:</strong></em> Dryad provides institutions with a
    new method their researchers can use to showcase their work.  It provides infrastructure for the
    preservation and dissemination of research data collected at the institution, as well as data from
    other institutions of value to its patrons.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Research funding organizations:</strong></em> Dryad provides a cost-effective
    mechanism for free, long-term access to data which, in turn, enables new research.  Data
    availability improves the rigor of the scientific record and public trust in the scientific
    enterprise.</p>
