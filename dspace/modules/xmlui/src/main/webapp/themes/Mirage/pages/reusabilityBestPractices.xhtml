            <p>So, you have decided to share your research data in Dryad? Congratulations! This is a huge first step. If you are unsure where to start or what you ‘should’ share, don’t worry, you are not alone. It’s not always obvious how to craft a data package with reusability in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to help you effectively communicate to the scientific community about your research to enhance both its <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/175/" target="_blank">visibility</a> and the potential for collaboration. To this end, we provide the following recommendations to help make your Dryad data packages as interpretable and reusable as possible:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list" style="list-style: none; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li><a href="#shareable">Make sure your data are shareable</a></li>
                <li><a href="#accessible">Make sure your data are accessible</a></li>
                <li><a href="#filenames">Name files and directories in a consistent and descriptive manner</a></li>
                <li><a href="#organize">Organize files in a logical schema</a></li>
                <li><a href="#allfiles">Provide all files necessary to recreate the analyses in your publication</a></li>
                <li><a href="#description">Provide a description of all details relevant to the data package</a></li>
                <li><a href="#examples">Examples of good reusability practices</a></li>
                <li><a href="#resources">Further resources</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="shareable">Make sure your data are shareable</h2>
            <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li>All files submitted to Dryad must abide by the terms of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Zero (CC0 1.0)</a>. Under these terms, the author releases the data to the public domain. Please review all files and ensure they conform to these terms (i.e., are not covered by any copyright claims). We cannot archive software or code files that contain licenses which are incompatible with CC0 (e.g., GNU GPL, MIT, CC BY), but we can provide a link to the files if they are in a dedicated software repository such as Github, Bitbucket, or CRAN. For more information on why Dryad uses Creative Commons Zero please see our <a href="/pages/faq">FAQ</a>.</li>
                <li>Human subjects data must be properly anonymized and prepared under applicable legal and ethical guidelines (see recommendations for <a href="/pages/humanSubjectsData">human subjects data</a>)</li>
                <li>For information on rare and endangered species, it may be necessary to mask certain details (e.g., locations) to prevent any further threat to these natural resources. Please review our recommendations for sharing rare and endangered species data responsibly. (See recommendations for  <a href="/pages/endangeredSpecies">endangered species data</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="accessible">Make sure your data are accessible</h2>
            <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li>Data should be in non-proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format" target="_blank">open formats</a> if possible (<a href="/pages/filetypes">see preferred formats</a>). Open format files ensure that your data will be accessible by the broadest number of people into the future.</li>
                <li>Review all of your files carefully for errors. Common errors include missing data, misnamed files, mislabeled variables, incorrectly formatted values, and corrupted file archives. It may be helpful to run data validation tools before sharing. For example, if you are working with tabular datasets, a service like <a href="http://goodtables.io/" target="_blank">goodTables</a> can identify missing data and data type formatting problems.</li>
                <li>Multiple files, or directories of files, can be bundled together into compressed file archives (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz). We recommend that large files do not exceed 10GB each. If you have a large directory of files, and there is a logical way to split it into subdirectories and compress those, we encourage you to do so. See our recommendations for <a href="http://wiki.datadryad.org/Large_File_Transfer" target="_blank">large file transfers</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="filenames">Name files and directories in a consistent and descriptive manner</h2>
            <p>Name files and directories in a consistent and descriptive manner All filenames should be organized in a consistent manner and clearly describe the content they contain. Ideally, the names will be concise, informative, and unique. Stanford Libraries provides some excellent advice in their <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming" target="_blank">best practices for file naming</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vague and ambiguous filenames should be avoided. Examples of poor filenames that should be avoided:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li>data.txt</li>
                <li>Latest tables for upload.xls</li>
                <li>Dryad Data (#1).csv</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It is also important to avoid including special characters and spaces in filenames because they can be problematic for computers to interpret. It is best to remove all blank spaces and use one of the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles" target="_blank">special letter case</a> patterns that is easily readable by both machines and people:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li>Kebab-case: "The-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog"</li>
                <li>CamelCase: "TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog"</li>
                <li>Snake_case: "The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We encourage authors to include the following types of information when naming files:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <li>Author name</li>
                <li>Project name</li>
                <li>Type of data</li>
                <li>Type of analysis</li>
                <li>Date</li>
                <li>File extension for application-specific files (e.g., .csv, .txt, .R, .xls, .fasta, .nii)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of descriptive file names that do not include special characters or spaces:
            </p>
                <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <li>1900-2000_sasquatch_migration_coordinates.csv</li>
                    <li>Smith-fMRI-neural-response-to-cupcakes-vs-vegetables.nii.gz</li>
                    <li>2015-SimulationOfTropicalFrogEvolution.R</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="organize">Organize files in a logical schema</h2>
                <p>
                    Just as with file naming, it is important to generate a clear file structure that will be interpretable by others. For instance, it may be sensible to segregate the data, code, and results of the data package as in the examples below (by file type or analysis as presented in your publication). However you choose to structure the data files, it will be helpful to your fellow researchers to explain all relevant details in a <a href="#description">README</a> file.
