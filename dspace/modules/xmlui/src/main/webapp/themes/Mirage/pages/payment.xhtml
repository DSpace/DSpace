        <p>Dryad is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organization that provides <strong>long-term access</strong> 
        to its contents at <strong>no cost</strong> to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of 
        nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to
        financial support from members and data submitters.</p>
    
        <p>Dryad's <strong>Data Publishing Charges (<abbr title="Data Publishing Charge">DPC</abbr>s)</strong> 
        are designed to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving 
        data. New innovations are enabled by research and development grants and by support from donors. (See a <a href="http://blog.datadryad.org/2015/12/15/new-pricing-structure-with-simplified-terms-and-increased-size-limits/">breakdown of Dryad's expenses</a>). The base charge per data package is $120.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Waivers</strong> are granted upon request for submissions originating from researchers based in 
        countries <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups">classified 
        by the World Bank as low-income or lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>     
		
		<p>DPCs are collected upon data publication. The submitter is asked to commit to the charge at the time of submission, and is charged if the accompanying publication is accepted, unless:</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>the associated journal, or another organization, has already contracted with Dryad to <a href="/pages/paymentPlans#sponsoring">sponsor the DPC</a>, or</li>
				<li>the submitter is based in a fee-waiver country (see above).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>To determine whether your DPC will be covered, <a href="/pages/journalLookup">look up your journal</a>. If there is no payment plan or sponsor in place, the DPC is $120.</p>  
        
      <h3>Excess data storage</h3> 
	<p>Dryad charges excess storage fees for data packages totaling over 20GB. These overage fees are charged to the submitter, even if there is a sponsor in place for the DPC.</p>
	<p>For data packages in excess of the 20GB size limit, submitters will be charged $50 for each additional 10GB, or part thereof. (Packages between 20 and 30GB = $50, between 30 and 40GB = $100, and so on).</p>

      <h3>Payment options</h3> 
	<p>DPCs and overage fees are payable by credit card. Prepaid DPC vouchers can be purchased by contacting <a href="mailto:help@datadryad.org">help@datadryad.org</a>, with bulk discounts for purchases of 25 or more.</p>
