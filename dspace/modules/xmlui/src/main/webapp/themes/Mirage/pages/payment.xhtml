		<p>Dryad is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organization that provides <strong>long-term access</strong> 
        to its contents at <strong>no cost</strong> to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of 
        nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to financial support from <a href="/pages/membershipOverview">members</a> and data submitters.</p>
		
		<p>Dryad's <strong>Data Publishing Charges (<abbr title="Data Publishing Charge">DPC</abbr>s)</strong> 
        are designed to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving 
        data. (See a <a href="http://blog.datadryad.org/2015/12/15/new-pricing-structure-with-simplified-terms-and-increased-size-limits/">breakdown of Dryad's expenses</a>).</p>

        <p><strong>Waivers</strong> are granted upon request for submissions originating from researchers based in countries <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups">classified by the World Bank as low-income or lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>    
		
		<p>The base DPC per data package is <span class="msg-DPC_pay_on_submission">$120</span>. DPCs are collected upon data publication. The submitter is asked to commit to the charge at the time of submission, and is charged if the accompanying publication is accepted, unless:</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>the associated journal, or another organization, has already contracted with Dryad to <a href="/pages/paymentPlans#sponsoring">sponsor the DPC</a>, or</li>
				<li>the submitter is based in a fee-waiver country (see above).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>To determine whether your DPC will be covered, <a href="/pages/journalLookup">look up your journal</a>. If there is no payment plan or sponsor in place, the DPC is <span class="msg-DPC_pay_on_submission">$120</span>.</p>  
        
      <h3>Excess data storage</h3> 
	<p>Dryad charges excess storage fees for data packages totaling over 20GB. These overage fees are charged to the submitter, even if there is a sponsor in place for the DPC.</p>
	<p>For data packages in excess of the 20GB size limit, submitters will be charged <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_first_surcharge">$50</span> for each additional 10GB, or part thereof. (Packages between 20 and 30GB = <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_first_surcharge">$50</span>, between 30 and 40GB = <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_double_first_surcharge">$100</span>, and so on).</p>

      <h3>Payment options</h3> 
	<p>DPCs and overage fees are payable by credit card.</p>
