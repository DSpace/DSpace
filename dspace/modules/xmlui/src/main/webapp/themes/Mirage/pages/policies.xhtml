</p>

<p><a href="#top">(back to top)</a></p>

<h2 id="publication">2. Publication Policies</h2>
<br />
<h3 id="content">2.1 Content Criteria</h3>

<p>Dryad only Accepts Content that meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Content must be associated with a published scholarly research Document.</li>
		<li>Content may only be submitted by an individual who represents and warrants that s/he is the creator and owner of the Content or otherwise has sufficient rights to be able to make the Content available under a CC0 Waiver. At Dryad's sole discretion, legacy Content may be permitted to be made available under other licensing terms.</li>
		<li>Content other than data may be Submitted to the Repository provided such Content is allowed by the Document publisher's policy.</li>
		<li>The Submitter represents and warrants that the Content is in compliance with the formatting and reporting guidelines of the Document's publisher.</li>
		<li>Most Data Packages in the Dryad Repository are associated with peer-reviewed Documents, although data associated with non-peer reviewed Documents from scholarly sources are also accepted.</li>
		<li>Ordinarily, one Data Package will consist of no more than 20 Gigabytes of Content, but Data Packages containing more than 20 Gigabytes of Content may be accepted and will incur an excess storage fee.</li>
		<li>The primary language of the Content must be English. Dryad curators cannot effectively review or curate submissions in other languages at this time.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="embargos">2.2 Embargos</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>By default, all accepted Content is made public upon publication of the associated Document.</li>
		<li>If instructed by a Submitter, and if not disallowed by the Submission Integration preferences specific to the publisher of the Document (see <a href="http://datadryad.org/pages/journalLookup">http://datadryad.org/pages/journalLookup</a> for a list of Submission Integration preferences by journal), the Repository will Embargo Publication of Content for a period of one year following the earliest publication of the associated Document.</li>
		<li>If instructed by a Submitter, and if not disallowed by the Submission Integration preferences specific to the publisher of the associated Document, and if approved by the publisher's designated editorial authority, an Embargo period of greater than one year, and not greater than ten years, may be applied. An Embargo must have an explicit termination date by the time of Content Publication.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="retraction">2.3 Expressions of Concern, Retraction and Removal of Data Files</h3>

<p>In general, Dryad defers authority to the Document publisher when issues arise regarding validity of Content. If Content in the Repository is associated with a Document for which there is an "expression of concern," "retraction," or similar statement on the part of the Document publisher, Dryad will continue to make the Content available, but with an appropriate warning and a link to the statement from the Document publisher. Data files that are updated as corrections to the original paper will be similarly linked to the publisher's corrigendum where Dryad is made aware of such.</p>

<p>Those who wish to see Content in the repository taken down, either for copyright infringement, because of privacy concerns, or for other legitimate cause, should contact <a href="mailto:curator@datadryad.org">curator@datadryad.org</a> providing the following:</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
		<li>Identification of the work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
		<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</li>
		<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
		<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
		<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p><strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dryad reserves the right to temporarily or permanently remove any Content at any time if Dryad determines in its sole discretion that the Content is inappropriate (containing personally identifiable, sensitive, infringing or otherwise illegal material, or Dryad is advised by legal counsel that inclusion of such Content presents a potential risk to Dryad); provided, however, Dryad shall not be responsible for screening Content prior to or after its Publication for such issues.</strong></p>

<h3 id="large-files">2.4 Large files</h3>

<p>During the process of submission and review, and with the knowledge and consent of the Submitter, unusually large files that are within the scope of another repository may be transferred for archiving by Dryad to that secondary repository without retention of a copy in the Repository.</p>

<p><a href="#top">(back to top)</a></p>


<h2 id="dryad-obligations">3. Dryad Obligations, Representations and Warranties to Purchasers and Submitters</h2>
<br />
<h3 id="curation">3.1 Curation</h3>  
<p>Dryad curation personnel will provide Submitter support and will review and curate Content prior to and following Publication as follows:</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Confirm that files can be opened, are not corrupted, and do not contain viruses which can be discovered through commercially reasonable efforts;</li>
		<li>Confirm that files contain information associated with a Document from a scientific, medical or other scholarly source;</li>
		<li>Confirm that metadata for the Document is technically correct;</li>
		<li>Confirm administrative metadata including, but not limited to, the embargo release date where applicable;</li>
		<li>Confirm that files are correctly versioned during the Review Workflow where applicable, and review updates to files and metadata Submitted either before or after Publication;</li>
		<li>Confirm that the Submission is covered by a Waiver or Payment Plan where applicable;</li>
		<li>Register Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for the Content;</li>
		<li>Resolve issues that come to the attention of curators after Publication including, but not limited to take-down requests and retraction notices.</li>
	</ol>
</p>	

<p>Dryad may, but is under no obligation to:</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Review Content for personally identifiable or otherwise sensitive or inappropriate information;	</li>
		<li>Review Content for copyright and license statements that are potentially incompatible with a CC0 Waiver;</li>
		<li>Review Content for compliance with file format and minimum reporting guidelines and alert Submitters or publishers when non-compliance is discovered.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>Dryad will not:</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make decisions regarding what Content is to be archived by the Document publisher rather than Submitted to the Repository;</li>
		<li>Check the scientific validity, veracity, accuracy or completeness of the Content;</li>
		<li>Guarantee compliance with content policies or guidelines set by Purchasers, Document publishers or funders in the absence of a separate contract for special curation services;</li>
		<li>Modify Content except as a by-product of format migration for preservation and accessibility.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="content-distribution">3.2 Content Distribution</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dryad will make Accepted Content available to the public under a CC0 Waiver and communicate scholarly norms for data reuse to Submitters and Users including, but not limited to, guidelines for data citation. However, Dryad shall NOT be responsible for enforcing scholarly norms.</li>
		<li>Dryad shall make commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the continual availability of the Repository at datadryad.org (subject to reasonable downtime for maintenance), and provide advance notice, when possible, of any material changes or discontinuities. However, Dryad shall NOT be responsible for the consequences of any downtime, disruptions or discontinuity of the Repository, Website or application programming interfaces.</li>
		<li>Dryad is NOT responsible for the uses of Published Data Packages made by third parties, including those who view and download Data Packages through the Repository.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="preservation">3.3 Preservation</h3>

<p>Dryad aims to maintain the integrity, availability and reusability of its Content over the long term. Note that it remains the responsibility of Submitters to provide sufficient metadata and background information in order to facilitate Users' understanding of the data.</p>

<p>This policy is informed by the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model (ISO 14721:2012) (<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57284">http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57284)</a> which defines "long term" to be a period of time long enough for there to be concern about the impacts of changing technologies, including support for new media and data formats, and of a changing user community.</p>	

<h4 id="formats">3.3.1 Preferred formats and format support levels</h4>

<p>While Dryad Accepts all data types and formats within reason, some formats are preferred. Curators may contact Submitters to request a file in an alternate format, and/or Dryad may save additional versions of files that have been transformed to preferred formats. Non-proprietary, openly documented formats are preferred if the format does not compromise reuse potential. Dryad recognizes that some formats may be preferred for reusability even if not ideal for preservation.</p>

<p>Preferred file formats:</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Text</strong>: plain text (ASCII, UTF-8), Open Office formats
			<ul>
				<li>Comma-separated (or otherwise delimited) values for tabular data</li>
				<li>Semi-structured plain text formats for non-tabular data (e.g., those used for nucleotide/protein sequences, alignments and phylogenies).</li>
				<li>XML and JSON for structured data</li>
				<li>Many community standard data exchange formats are listed in the BioSharing catalogue (<a href="http://biosharing.org">http://biosharing.org</a>).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Images</strong>: PDF/A, JPEG/JPEG2000, PNG, TIFF, SVG/</li>
		<li><strong>Audio</strong>: FLAC, AIFF, WAVE</li>
		<li><strong>Video</strong>: AVI, M-JPEG2000</li>
		<li><strong>Compressed/archived formats</strong>: GZIP/TAR, ZIP
			<ul>
				<li>Files may be compressed and/or archived when necessary due to large file size, a large number of files (more than 10), or the need to gather files together in a particular directory structure in order for them to be understood.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>README files</strong>: should ideally be in plain text format.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Format support levels:</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Full support</strong>: Dryad will make a best effort to ensure the properties and behaviors into the future of Content submitted in a preferred format or other common format as enumerated below, including future format migration.
			<ul>
				<li>Text: TXT (ASCII, UTF-8), PDF/A, RTF, CSV/TSV/TAB</li>
				<li>Office: Open Office (ODS, ODP, ODT), Microsoft Office (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX)</li>
				<li>Markup: HTML/XHTML, XML, Nexus formats (NEX, NEXML)</li>
				<li>Image: PDF/A, JPEG/JPEG2000, PNG, GIF, TIFF, SVG (no Java)</li>
				<li>Audio: FLAC, AIFF, WAV, MP3</li>
				<li>Video: AVI, M-JPEG2000, MP4</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Limited support</strong>: For uncommon formats for which we are less confident there will be robust conversion tools, Dryad will make some effort to ensure the future readability and functionality, but there may be some loss. Examples would include PDF files that are not compliant with the requirements of PDF/A.</li>
		<li><strong>As-is bitstream access</strong>: For binary files from proprietary instrumentation and software and other exotic formats, Dryad preserves the bitstream as-is and makes no commitment to format transformation or future usability.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
	
<h4 id="preservation-procedures">3.3.2 Procedures for preservation</h4>

<p>Dryad aims to preserve the originally submitted Content indefinitely. Steps to ensure long-term availability include:</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Persistent identification in the form of DOIs.</li>
		<li>Replication of data and metadata.</li>
		<li>Periodic verification that stored content remains uncorrupted. Upon ingest, an MD5 checksum is calculated and recorded for each submitted data file. Integrity checks are run nightly.</li>
		<li>If data objects are found to be corrupted, affected data will be restored from known-good copies as appropriate.</li>
		<li>To prevent data loss, multiple copies of content are kept at different sites.</li>
		<li>Prior to release, files are manually inspected by a Dryad curator. Any issues that affect preservation (i.e., file corruption, etc.) are addressed before release.</li>
		<li>Ingest, curation, and publication actions are documented by provenance metadata.</li>
		<li>Dryad content is replicated through participation in the DataONE network.</li>
		<li>To the greatest extent possible, personnel create documentation to reflect their activities. We strive to ensure that more than one employee can perform each critical function of the repository.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4 id="security">3.3.3 Security</h4>

<p>Full backup copies of Repository Contents are stored in multiple secure facilities offsite. All Contents in Dryad are incrementally backed up every ten minutes. Full backups are made every 24 hours. Repository systems are password protected. The server rooms are locked, with access restricted to key staff members, and patrolled by campus security. The server rooms are equipped with fire prevention and protection system, physical intruder detection systems and environmental control systems.</p>

<h4 id="versioning">3.3.4 Versioning</h4>

<p>Dryad Data Packages may be Versioned in order to correct errors in the archived files or to provide additional data associated with the analysis reported in the associated Document.</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dryad shall include updated files in the Repository while retaining and allowing access to the original files and all prior Published Versions.</li>
		<li>Each file will be given a unique identifier (DOI) and the metadata of the Data Package will be updated to include information about the order of the Versions.</li>
		<li>The Data Package DOI and Dryad search results point to the most recent Version of a data package, which displays a history that allows users to navigate to earlier Versions.</li>
		<li>Older Versions of the Data Package also display the Version history and a prominent warning message that this is not the current Version.</li>
		<li>The Version history includes a brief statement of the reason for Versioning and timestamps of Versioning events.</li>
		<li>New Versions may be initiated by a Dryad curator at the author's or journal's request.</li>
		<li>New Versions will be preserved following the preservation procedures outlined in <a href="#preservation-procedures">section 3.3.2</a>.</li>
		<li>Versioning is not intended to support frequent updates to ongoing data sets or to extend the Data Package beyond the scope of its associated Document.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4 id="sustainability">3.3.5 Sustainability</h4>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Technical sustainability</strong>: Dryad's software is built upon DSpace, an open-source software platform for managing digital collections. DSpace (<a href="http://dspace.org">http://dspace.org</a>) is used and maintained by hundreds of institutions around the world, ensuring that it will continue to function for the foreseeable future. All Dryad-specific modifications of DSpace are available on github (<a href="https://github.com/datadryad/dryad-repo">https://github.com/datadryad/dryad-repo</a>) with an open-source license. This ensures that other parties may inspect the code, propose updates, submit corrections, and even maintain the codebase should that become necessary.</li>
		<li><strong>Content accessibility</strong>: Through registration of DOIs for Data Packages and files, Dryad shows its commitment to online preservation of its Content for many years to come. Registration also allows identifiers to be seamlessly redirected in the event of URL changes. Dryad's participation in the DataONE network ensures that all its data will be available through other institutions if the Dryad organization ever dissolves.</li>
		<li><strong>Institutional and financial sustainability</strong>: Dryad's governance and business model are designed to provide for long-term organizational stability and viability, ensuring that revenues from Data Publishing Charges (DPCs) cover the Repository's core operating costs (including curation, storage, and maintenance). Thus, long-term funding for Dryad is not dependent on a small number of grants, or the continued largesse of a single host institution.</li>
	</ul>
</p>	
		
<h3 id="dryad-reps">3.4 Representations and Warranties</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dryad represents and warrants that it has the authority to enter into the Purchase Agreement (in the case of Purchasers) and these Terms of Service (in the case of Purchasers, Submitters and other Users), and to bind itself to the Terms of Service herein.</li>
		<li>In the case of a Purchase Agreement, Dryad further represents and warrants to the Purchaser that it has caused the Purchase Agreement to be executed by a duly authorized representative.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><a href="#top">(back to top)</a></p>

<h2 id="purchaser-obligations">4. Purchaser Obligations, Representations and Warranties to Dryad</h2>

<p>Purchaser Obligations:</p>
<p>
	<ul>

		<li>Purchaser is responsible for informing Dryad of any changes to its contact information in the Purchase Agreement.</li>
		<li>Purchasers may not Submit Content on behalf of Submitters without the express permission and full knowledge of the Submitter, including explicit agreement to the Dryad Terms of Service.</li>
		<li>Purchasers who wish to review Content prior to Publication in the Repository must use the Review Workflow for Integrated Submission.</li>
		<li>Purchasers who use the Subscription Plan must maintain Submission Integration for all covered journals.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

	</ul>
</p>
			
<p><a href="#top">(back to top)</a></p>

<h2 id="submitter-obligations">5. Submitter Obligations, Representations and Warranties to Dryad</h2>
<br />
<h3 id="permission">5.1 Permission</h3>

<ul>
	<li>By Submitting Content to the Repository, Submitter grants Dryad irrevocable permission to make the Data Package available to the public under a CC0 Waiver.</li>
	<li>Unless otherwise indicated during the Submission process to the Repository (see <a href="#embargos">Section 2.2</a>), the Submitter agrees that Content may be Published once the associated Document has been published.</li>
	<li>􏰀Submitter further grants Dryad permission to (i) promote and advertise the availability of the Data Package; (ii) re-format or otherwise transform the Data Package in any way to ensure its accessibility and preservability; (iii) modify and incorporate metadata or other documentation in the Content; and (iv) take any steps Dryad deems necessary in its sole discretion to remove inappropriate Content; provided however, Dryad shall have no responsibility to screen or remove inappropriate Content from Submissions.</li>

<h3 id="termination">9.1 Termination</h3>

<p>Dryad reserves the right to suspend use by any party (Submitter, Purchaser or User) if that party engages in, or is suspected of engaging in, Prohibited Activities or in any other way breaches any of the party's obligations, representations or warranties hereunder.</p>

Submitter/Purchaser/User (as the case may be) may not assign or otherwise transfer its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of Dryad, and any transfer to the contrary shall be null and void. Dryad reserves the right to transfer all of its rights and obligations under any Purchase Agreement and these Terms of Service, including ownership and/or operation of the Dryad Repository to another nonprofit entity in the event of a merger, joint venture, dissolution, or other corporate restructuring.</p>
