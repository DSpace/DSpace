     <h2 class="special-announcement">Dryad will introduce a data publishing charge<br/>starting on the <span style="color: #40841c;">1st of September 2013</span>. Authors will not be charged for submissions made prior to September 1, even if the submissions are accepted after that date.</h2>

     <p>Dryad is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organization that provides <strong>long-term access</strong> 
     to its contents at <strong>no cost</strong> to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of 
     nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to
     financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad’s data publishing charges are designed to 
     sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data. New 
     innovations are enabled by research and development grants and by support from donors.</p>

     <h1 class="ds-div-head" style="font-size: 150%; color: #40841c; margin-bottom: 10px;">Membership Dues</h1>

      <p>Organizations can be a part of Dryad by becoming members, participating in a payment plan, or both.  For membership information and dues, please see <a href="/pages/membershipOverview#becomeAMember">Become a member</a>.  Members have a voice in the governance of Dryad and receive discounts on data publishing charges.  Membership is open to any organization supporting the mission of Dryad.</p>

     <h1 class="ds-div-head" style="font-size: 150%; color: #40841c; margin-bottom: 10px;">Pricing Plans</h1>

      <p>Organizations (including publishers, scientific societies, libraries, funders, and others) are 
      encouraged to cover the costs of data publishing charges on behalf of their community of researchers. For 
      instance, a society or publisher may cover the costs for all the authors of its journals. To do 
      this, Dryad offers a variety of flexible payment plans that provide for volume discounts. If no 
      payment plan is in place, authors must pay the DPC when their data is accepted by Dryad. Researchers 
      from economically developing countries may submit data at no charge.  
      Please contact <a href="mailto:director@datadryad.org">director@datadryad.org</a> to
      discuss which payment plan would be most suitable for your organization.</p>

      <h2>Plan 1: Voucher Plan</h2>
      <p>Organizations are invited to purchase a block of vouchers for future submissions at a base charge of 
      USD$65 per data package for members and USD$70 for non-members. The minimum purchase is 25 vouchers.  This plan is open to any organization.</p>

      <h2>Plan 2: Deferred Payment</h2>
      <p>Under the Deferred Payment Plan, data publishing charges are invoiced for the number of
      packages submitted in the previous quarter. The base charge is USD$70 per data package for members and 
      USD$75 for non-members. Participants must enter into a contract of at least one-year 
      duration and may cap the number of submissions for which they are charged. This plan is open to publishers, publishing societies and independent journals.</p>

      <h2>Plan 3: Subscription</h2>
      <p>A journal (or journals) with an active Subscription Plan may make an unlimited number of submissions 
      for a fixed cost. This cost is calculated based on the total number of research articles
      published by the journal(s) in the prior year, with a base charge of USD$25 per research article for
      members and USD$30 for non-members. The minimum contract duration is two years, which can start at any
      time. Submission Integration is required for subscribing journals.</p>

      <h2>For individuals: Pay on submission</h2>
      <p>If none of the above payment plans is applicable to a given submission, a base charge of USD$80 is
      charged, payable by the submitter at the time of submission. <strong>Waivers</strong> are granted
      upon request for submissions originating from researchers based in <a
      href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups" target="_blank">countries
      classified by the World Bank as low-income or lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Pricing Plan Comparison Tool</h2>
      <p>Use our online <a href="/pages/pricingPlanComparisonTool">Pricing Plan Comparison Tool</a> to compare the annual cost of Dryad's pricing plans for
       members and non-members.</p>

      <table class="pricing-table">
          <thead>
              <tr><th>Payment Plan</th><th>Member</th><th>Non-member</th><th>Minimum purchase</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
              <tr class="odd"><td class="plan-name">1. Voucher Plan</td><td>USD$65 per data package</td><td>USD$70 per data package</td><td>25 vouchers</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="plan-name">2. Deferred Payment Plan</td><td>USD$70 per data package</td><td>USD$75 per data package</td><td>1 yr contract</td></tr>
              <tr class="odd"><td class="plan-name">3. Subscription Plan</td><td>annual fee based on USD$25 per published research article</td><td>annual fee based on USD$30 per published research article</td><td>2 yr contract</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="plan-name">For individuals:<br/>Pay on submission</td><td>NA</td><td>USD$80 per data package, payable by the submitter</td><td>1 data package</td></tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>While base data publishing charges cover the entire cost of most submissions, two additional charges may apply.</p>

      <h2>Excess data storage</h2>
      <p>For data packages in excess of the 10 GB size limit, USD$15 will be charged for the first
      GB and USD$10 for each additional GB or part thereof, payable by the submitter.</p>

      <h2>Non-integrated submission</h2>
      <p>For data from journals without <a href="/pages/integratedJournals">integrated submission</a>, an additional USD$10 will be charged to individual
      submitters payable at the time of submission, to cover added curation costs.</p>
