                <p>Preservation of data by libraries and repositories such as Dryad is more important than ever. With multiple options available to fit your needs, Dryad can be a valued resource for academic libraries that aim to support data preservation and advance the culture of open science. Dryad is a non-profit company that developed out of a collaboration among researchers, librarians, and journal editors; we share a common goal with academic libraries.  Let’s work together to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>You’re already working with data - here's how Dryad can help:</h2>
                <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <li>focuses exclusively on <strong>data that underlies scholarly literature</strong>, is linked to the literature, and is openly available</li>

                    <li>provides <strong>high visibility and discoverability</strong> of data - while institutional repositories (IR) play an important role in data preservation, IR data can be difficult to access and reuse</li>
                    <li><strong>curates all data packages</strong> to ensure the validity of the files and metadata</li>
                    <li>provides data <strong>free to the public under CC0 </strong>terms of reuse</li>
                    <li>cares about <strong>long-term preservation</strong> of research objects</li>

                <h2>Integration with the Dryad Submission System</h2>
                <p>If your library system includes a university press that publishes journals, coordinate the submission of manuscripts with submission of data to Dryad.
