                <p>Preservation of data by libraries and repositories such as Dryad is more important than ever. With multiple options available to fit your needs, Dryad can be a valued resource for academic libraries that aim to support data preservation and advance the culture of open science. Dryad is a non-profit company that developed out of a collaboration among researchers, librarians, and journal editors; we share a common goal with academic libraries.  Let’s work together to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge.
                </p>
