      <h1>Dryad Fact Sheet</h1>
      <h2>What is Dryad?</h2>
      <p>Dryad is a digital repository for data underlying published works developed by the <a
          href="http://www.nescent.org">National Evolutionary Synthesis Center</a> and the
        University of North Carolina <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/">Metadata Research Center</a>,
        in coordination with a large group of <a href="/partners">Journals and
        Societies</a>.</p>

      <h2>What are the goals?</h2>
      <ul class="text-list">
        <li>To preserve all the underlying data reported in a paper at the time of publication, when
          there is the greatest incentive and the ability for authors to share their data. This is
          particularly important in the case of data for which a specialized repository does not
          exist.</li>
        <li>To lower the burden of data sharing by providing one-stop data-deposition via
          handshaking with specialized repositories.</li>
        <li>To assign globally unique identifiers to datasets, thus enabling data citations.</li>
        <li>To allow end-users to perform sophisticated searches over data (not only by publication,
          but also by taxon, geography, geological age, biological concept, etc).</li>
        <li>To allow journals and societies to pool their resources for one shared repository.</li>
        <li>To enable bidirectional search and retrieval with data repositories from related
          disciplines.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What societies and journals have been involved and supportive of the effort?</h2>
      <p>Dryad maintains a list of <a href="/partners">journals and societies supporting
          Dryad</a>. Additional societies and journals are invited to join the consortium at any
        time. The following charter organizations are cosignatories on the original Joint Data
        Archiving and/or provided letters in support of Dryad to the National Science
        Foundation:</p>
      <ul class="text-list">
        <li>American Society of Naturalists</li>
        <li>European Society for Evolutionary Biology</li>
        <li>Molecular Ecology</li>
        <li>Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution</li>
        <li>Society for the Study of Evolution</li>
        <li>Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology</li>
        <li>Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution</li>
        <li>Society of Systematic Biologists</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The strategic priorities for Dryad emerged from a May 2007 workshop on &quot;Data
        Preservation, Sharing, and Discovery: Challenges for Small Science in the Digital Era&quot;,
        at which a variety of stakeholder journals and societies were represented. The <a
          href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_dryad/DRIADE_Workshop_May_2007">workshop report</a> is
        available.</p>

      <h2>Is data submission required for publication?</h2>
      <p>Currently, while the system is being developed, submission is voluntary. However, long-term
        success of the repository depends on data submission being required for publication by
        journals. The decision as to when the system is sufficiently mature to impose that
        requirement rests with the partner journals and societies, through their representatives to
        the Dryad Consortium Board.</p>

      <h2>What kinds and formats of data does Dryad store?</h2>
      <p>Dryad accepts data in any format as long as it is associated with a primary publication.
        Preferred formats are specified where appropriate. Dryad curators do some quality
        control to ensure the electronic files are valid and contain what they advertise, but the
        final responsibility for data quality is in the hands of the submitter.</p>
      <p>Datasets of particular historical, educational and scientific significance are being
        solicited for inclusion in a special section of the repository. Unpublished data is not
        being accepted unless it is within one of these special collections.</p>

      <h2>Are there restrictions on how archived data can be used?</h2>
      <p>Dryad submitters are required to place all data in the public domain using the <a
          href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero
        waiver</a>. Others can share, copy, or reuse the data. Since some
        types of data are not eligible for copyright protection, this ensures that the data
        can be reused legally in all situations. According to scientific norms, others who use the
        data are still obligated to cite the original creator of the data (see the <a
          href="/using">usage page</a> for suggested citation formats).</p>
      <p>Authors depositing data may choose to embargo the data for a year after publication.</p>

      <h2>How is data submitted?</h2>

      <p>Authors may submit data files to Dryad now, as long as the data are associated with a published article.  Authors who have an article in one of the journals that have <a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_dryad/Submission_Integration">integrated their manuscript processing</a> with Dryad may also deposit data in conjunction with the article acceptance process.  </p>

      <p>The data deposit process involves 3 steps:</p>
      
      <ol class="text-list">
	<li>Describe your publication</li>
	<li>Upload and describe your data files</li>
	<li>Approve data for publication</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP33cl8tL28">2-minute video</a> demonstrates the data deposit process from start to finish. Start the data deposit process <a href="/submissions">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Once the data deposit is complete, the depositor will receive a <a href="http://www.doi.org/faq.html#1">Digital Object Identifer, or DOI</a>: a unique identifier for the data files in Dryad. Including the data DOI in the published article ensures that readers of the article can find the supporting data in Dryad. </p>
      
      <h2>What additional documentation is required?</h2>
      <p>If additional information would be required for another researcher to make use of the data
        (e.g., description of the column headings in a spreadsheet, or detailed documentation of a
        piece of software), this should be provided as a README file.</p>

      <h2>Is the repository software being designed from scratch?</h2>

      <p><strong>Dryad is an open-source project.</strong></p>
      <p> Dryad is built upon the <a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a> repository software
        developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Hewlett-Packard, with a number of
        customizations. All customizations not available within the main DSpace distribution are available from the <a href="https://github.com/datadryad/dryad-repo">Dryad code repository</a> under a new BSD license. </p>

    	<p>Information on programmatic access to Dryad's data is <a href="http://wiki.datadryad.org/wiki/Data_Access">available on the Dryad wiki</a>.</p>


      <h2>How is the repository managed, staffed, and funded?</h2>
      <p>The Consortium Board is responsible for setting policy and long-term strategic goals. One representative appointed by each of the consortium journals, its governing society, or publisher is included. NESCent will appoint additional <em>ex officio</em> members.</p>

      <p>The development of Dryad is a joint project of <a href="http://www.nescent.org/">NESCent</a>, the <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/">UNC Metadata Research Center</a>, and a growing number of <a href="/partners">partner organizations</a>. Funding for the development of the repository is described <a href="https://www.nescent.org/wg_dryad/Current_funding">here</a>. </p>

      <h2>How can journals, societies, and publishers participate?</h2>
      <ul class="text-list">
        <li>Adopt the <a href="/jdap">Joint Data Archiving
            Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>Become a formal partner, named in Dryad's promotional materials and fundraising
          efforts.</li>
        <li>Encourage authors in their acceptance letters to submit data for published papers to
          Dryad.</li>
        <li>Appoint an official representative to the Dryad Consortium Board.</li>
        <li>Implement an agreement of cooperation with publishers to integrate the journal article
          and data submission processes with Dryad.</li>
      </ul>
