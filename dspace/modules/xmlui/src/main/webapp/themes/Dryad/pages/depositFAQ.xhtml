         <h1>Frequently Asked Questions - Depositing Data</h1>
         
         <h2>What makes Dryad different from other repositories?</h2>
         <p>Dryad's mission is to preserve and share all digital data underlying published articles. Thus,
            the repository does not provide highly specialized tools for a particular group of organisms or
            a particular kind of data. Dryad works to exchange data with more specialized repositories and
            databases, particularly those required by journals for publication of particular kinds of data
            (e.g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">Genbank</a>, <a href="http://www.treebase.org/">Treebase</a>).</p>
         
         <h2>Why should I submit my data/metadata?</h2>
         <p>A data repository provides benefits both to data submitters and to the larger scientific
            community. Data are protected against loss, and the metadata provided helps to make the data
            intelligible. The data can also be used to answer questions unanticipated at the time of the
            original study. Research suggests that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1154562">open
               access to publications increases citation</a>, and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308">open access to data increases citation</a> as well. Open access to data simply makes it easier
            for others to use the results of your publication. Future researchers can examine the effect of
            new analysis techniques. They can also combine data from different studies to examine trends and
            make broader generalizations.</p>
         
         <h2>What rights do I have after I submit my data?</h2>
         <p>You do not give up any rights to your data. You may continue to use the data as if it had not
            been deposited, as well as publish your data on other sites.</p>
         
         <h2>What about people stealing my data?</h2>
         <p>Once data is published, anyone may view the data, analyze it, and cite it. There is little
            difference between publishing data and publishing articles. Yes, it is possible that someone
            will analyze your data in a way you hadn't expected. But they must still cite you as the creator
            of the original data.</p>
         
         <h2>What kinds of data can I submit?</h2>
         <p>Dryad will accept data in any format. However, technologies change, and not all data formats
            are equally easy to preserve. See the <a href="/collectionPolicy">Dryad Data Collection
               Policy</a> for information about Dryad's policies for specific types of data. </p>
         
         <h2>Is software an acceptable type of "data"?</h2>
         <p>Dryad does allow storage of software source code, and we would
            be happy to accept it.</p>
         
         <p>However, be aware that all content submitted to Dryad must be placed
            under the <a
               href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
               target="_blank">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a> waiver. If your code
            includes portions of code from other people, you may not be able to release it
            under the terms of CC0. In the future, Dryad will allow alternative
            licenses for source code.</p>
         
         <p>If you intend to continue development of the software, you may
            want to place it in a repository that was specifically designed for
            code, such as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/"
               target="_blank">SourceForge</a> or <a
                  href="http://code.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Code</a>.</p>
         
         <h2>Are there limits to the data I can submit?</h2>
         <p>Submissions are limited to 1GB per data file, and the entire package of data files submitted
            for an article must be less than 10GB. Data that is deemed to lack sufficient scientific merit
            may be removed from the repository.</p>
         
         <h2>What documentation is required along with the data?</h2>
         <p>When you submit a data package, it will be associated with a "primary" article. If the article
            describes the data sufficiently, no other documentation is required. If additional information
            would be required for another researcher to make use of a data file (e.g., description of the
            column headings in a spreadsheet, or detailed documentation of a piece of software), this
            documentation should be made available in a file called README, submitted at the same time as
            the data.</p>
         
         <h2>How can I make my data most useful to other researchers?</h2>
         <p>Best practices for data storage and management are described in a recent publication:</p>

         <h2>Who else is submitting data to this repository?</h2>
         <p>All authors submitting articles to our <a href="/partners">partner journals</a> will be asked to submit data to the repository.
            In addition, data of particular historical, educational and scientific significance are being
            solicited for inclusion in the repository. </p>
         
         <h2>Is anyone using/citing my data?</h2>
         <p>We are developing methods for citation information to be displayed along with other basic
            information about each data file. Until this is fully developed, the Dryad team is happy to
            provide basic statistics on how often your data has been accessed from the repository. Please
            email us at <a href="mailto:help@datadryad.org">help@datadryad.org</a>.</p>
         
         <h2>Can I submit data associated with my unpublished manuscript?</h2>
         <p>At this point, we are only accepting data associated with
            publications. In the future, Dryad will provide a method for data
            to be preserved while a manuscript is in review. Please see the 
            <a href="/collectionPolicy">Dryad Data Collection Policy</a> for details.</p>
         
         <h2>Can I release my data under an alternative license?</h2>
         <p>All data submitted to Dryad must be released under the <a
            href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero waiver</a>,
            which waives any rights you may have under copyright law or related laws.</p>
         <p>In most cases, applying this waiver does not change the legal status of your data. Factual
            information, including most data in Dryad, is not eligible for copyright protection. While it is
            possible to apply copyright protections to the arrangement of a data file (e.g., a database
            schema), the data itself cannot be protected under copyright law. (See <a
               href="http://sciencecommons.org/resources/faq/databases#canicc">commentary from the Science
               Commons arm of Creative Commons</a>, as well as <a
