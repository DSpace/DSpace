         <h2>Why should I choose Dryad for my data?</h2>
         <p class="ds-paragraph">
            Dryad aims to make data archiving as <b>simple</b> and as <b>rewarding</b> as possible:
         </p>
         <h3>Simple</h3>
         <ul class="text-list">
            <li>Dryad welcomes <b>data files associated with any published article in the biosciences,</b> as well as <b>software scripts and other files</b> 
            important to the article.</li>
            <li>There is no restriction regarding <a href="#what">data formats</a>.</li>
            <li>Dryad works with journals to <b>integrate article and data submission</b>, streamlining the deposit process. 
               Once the files are prepared, deposition typically takes <b>less than 15 minutes</b> (2-minute video <a href="http://youtu.be/RP33cl8tL28">here</a>).</li>
            <li>Data destined for <b>more specialized repositories</b> can, in some cases, be submitted through Dryad, 
            reducing the time and complexity of data submission yet further.</li>
            <li>Dryad provides a single clear and best-practice option for <a href="http://blog.datadryad.org/2011/10/05/why-does-dryad-use-cc0/">terms of reuse</a>.</li>
            <li>A <b>curator</b> will check your files for technical problems before they are released.</li>
            <li>By default, data are <b>embargoed</b> until journal article publication.  Dryad makes sure this happens so you do not need to.</li>
            <li>If it is supported by the policy of the journal, you may, during the submission process, select a <b>‘no-questions-asked’ embargo</b> on 
            data downloads for one year post-publication.  Dryad will support a longer embargo if directed by a journal editor.</li>
            <li>You are free to provide additional <b>keywords</b> that make the data easier to discover and additional <b>documentation</b> 
            (in the form of README files) to help ensure proper data reuse.</li>
            <li>You have the ability to add <b>new versions</b> of data files in order to make updates or corrections.</li>
            <li>Dryad can make data <b>securely available for peer review</b> at the request of the journal.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Rewarding</h3>
         <ul class="text-list">
            <li>Dryad works to ensure that you get <b>credit for reuse of your data</b> by promoting adoption of best-practice data 
               <a href="http://datadryad.org/using#howCite">citation policy</a> and the trackability of data citations.</li>
            <li>Data files receive <b>persistent, resolvable</b> <a href="http://datadryad.org/depositing#whatDOI">Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)</a> 
            that can be used in a citation as well as listed on your CV.</li>
            <li>Dryad’s <a href="http://datadryad.org/depositing#whycc0">terms of reuse</a> for data <b>facilitate the maximum impact</b> for your work.</li>
            <li>Data in Dryad are <b>independently discoverable</b>, providing a new route by which others may learn about your work.</li>
            <li>Discovery is supported through the <b>indexing</b> of Dryad’s contents by services such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, and others.</li>
            <li><b>Usage statistics</b> are available for you to highlight when your datasets are frequently downloaded.</li>
            <li>Since Dryad does not reject data for being of the wrong type or in the wrong format, <b>all the data files associated with 
            an article can be archived together.</b> </li>
            <li>Dryad can host files that are <b>larger</b> than those accepted by most journal websites (up to 1 GB per file and 10 GB per package).</li>
            <li>Your data are <b>preserved</b> and made available for the long-term, even beyond the lifespan of Dryad, 
               through continuous backup and replication services.</li>
            <li>Dryad is <b>community-led</b>, with priorities and policies shaped by the members of the Dryad Consortium, 
               including scientific societies, publishers, and other stakeholder organizations.</li>
            <li>Dryad is a nonprofit, but takes <b>sustainability</b> seriously, ensuring that funds are available for long-term preservation.</li>
            <li>Dryad is an active participant in organizations developing <b>best-practices for data management</b> such as 
               <a href="http://www.biosharing.org/">Biosharing</a>, <a href="http://datacite.org">DataCite</a> and 
               <a href="http://www.dataone.org/">DataONE</a>.  You as a researcher benefit from, and contribute to, the work of these 
               organizations by depositing and using Dryad.</li>

         <h2>What should you deposit?</h2>
         <p class="ds-paragraph">It is impossible to predict precisely which data will be most
            useful to researchers in the future. Dryad recommends depositing as much data as
            possible, in accordance with the following guidelines: </p>
         <ul class="text-list">
            <li>Dryad collects data underlying peer-reviewed articles in the basic and applied
               biosciences.</li>
            <li>All data files must be associated with a publication.</li>
            <li>Authors should ideally submit sufficient data and metadata (i.e., documentation or
               descriptive information about the data) such that another researcher would be able to
               evaluate and reproduce the findings described in the publication.</li>
            <li>Data should be archived at the stage where it is ready for statistical
               analysis.</li>
            <li>Archived data files may include, but are not limited to: <ul class="text-list">
                  <li>spreadsheets or other tables</li>
                  <li>images or maps</li>
                  <li>alignments</li>
                  <li>character matrices</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You may also submit data that was originally collected for another publication, as
               long as that data is referenced by the current publication. </li>
         </ul>
         <a name="recommend"> </a>
         <h2>Recommendations for authors</h2>
         <p class="ds-paragraph">Please provide a README file for each data package you deposit so
            that the data can be correctly interpreted. Multiple README files may be submitted if it
            is necessary to document each data file separately.</p>
         <ol class="text-list">
            <li>Write your README file in a plain text file</li>
            <li>Introductory information should include: <ul class="text-list">
                  <li>for each filename, a short description of what data it includes</li>
                  <li>who collected the data and whom to contact with questions </li>
               </ul></li>
            <li>Describe: <ul class="text-list">
                  <li>column headings for any tabular data</li>
                  <li>the units of measurement used</li>
                  <li>what symbols are used to record missing data</li>
                  <li>any specialized formats or abbreviations used</li>
                  <li>any additional related data collected that was not included in the current
                     data package</li>
               </ul></li>
            <li>Use standardized formats and follow scientific conventions in both your README file
               and in your data files: <ul class="text-list">
                  <li><b>Dates:</b> Dryad suggests you follow the <a

                     which specifies the international standard notation of YYYYMMDD. <blockquote>

         <h2>Suggestions for data management</h2>
         <p class="ds-paragraph">While preparing your data, Dryad recommends you follow these
            guidelines:</p>
         <ul class="text-list">
            <li>Start preparing your data for archiving when it is collected and analyzed.</li>
            <li>Use non-proprietary file formats wherever possible; they are more likely to be
               readable in the future. For example, a plain text file has a longer life than a
               propriety word processing format, and a file of comma or tab-delimited values has a
               longer life than a proprietary spreadsheet file format. Consider using <b>text
                  only</b> (ASCII) within spreadsheets and other documents; color, images, and other
               embedded objects are difficult to migrate.</li>
            <li> If you are unsure whether your data is stored in a format that will be supported
               long-term, please see this <a
                  href="http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/recommended_file_formats">list of
                  preferred file formats</a> from the University of Texas. </li>
            <li>Use descriptive file names to reflect the contents of the file. Include enough
               information to uniquely identify the data file and distinguish files from one
               another. File names should be included in the README documentation.</li>
            <li>For spreadsheets, explain all column or row codes in the file and/or README
               document, and indicate what units are used.</li>
            <li>Be as explicit (and consistent) as possible about references to external resources
               (such as database identifiers, or controlled vocabularies). </li>
         </ul>

         <p>All data submitted to Dryad is released to the public domain under <a
               href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ ">Creative Commons Zero
               (CC0)</a>, which reduces legal and technical impediments to the reuse of data by
            waiving copyright and related rights to the extent permitted by law. In most cases, CC0
            does not actually affect the legal status of your data, since facts in and of themselves
            are not eligible for copyright in most countries (e.g. see this <a
               href="http://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/unprotected.html#ideas">commentary from
               Bitlaw</a> regarding U.S. copyright law).</p>
         <p>CC0 does not exempt those who reuse the data from following community norms for
            scholarly communication, in particular from citation of the original data authors. On
            the contrary, by removing unenforcable legal barriers, CC0 facilitates the discovery,
            reuse, and citation of that data. </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Community norms can be a much more effective way of encouraging positive
               behaviour, such as citation, than applying licenses. A well functioning community
               supports its members in their application of norms, whereas licences can only be
               enforced through court action and thus invite people to ignore them when they are
               confident that this is unlikely.&quot; (<a
                  href="http://pantonprinciples.org/faq/#q10-what-are-community-norms-and-why-are-they-important "
                  >Panton Principles FAQ</a>)</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>We follow the Science Commons recommendations regarding scientific data, which
            discourage researchers from presuming copyright and using licenses that include
            &quot;attribution&quot; and &quot;share-alike&quot; conditions. It is the position of
            the Dryad Consortium that a legal requirement for attribution is not the appropriate
            mechanism to enforce the community norm for attribution:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;when you federate a query from 50,000 databases (not now, perhaps, but
               definitely within the 70-year duration of copyright!) will you be liable to a lawsuit
               if you don’t formally attribute all 50,000 owners?&quot; (<a
                  href="http://sciencecommons.org/resources/faq/database-protocol/">Science Commons
                  Database Protocol FAQ</a>)</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>While &quot;share-alike&quot; conditions create an unnecessary legal tangle:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;share-alike&quot; licenses typically impose the condition that some or
               all derivative products be identically licensed. Such conditions have been known to
               create significant &quot;license compatibility&quot; problems under existing license
               schemes that employ them. In the context of data, license compatibility problems will
               likely create significant barriers for data integration and reuse for both providers
               and users of data.&quot; (<a
                  href="http://sciencecommons.org/resources/faq/database-protocol/">Science Commons
                  Database Protocol FAQ</a>)</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Thus,</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;... given the potential for significantly negative unintended consequences of
               using copyright, the size of the public domain, and the power of norms inside
               science, we believe that copyright licenses and contractual restrictions are simply
               the wrong tool [for data], even if those licenses and contracts are used with the
               best of intentions.&quot; (<a
                  href="http://sciencecommons.org/resources/faq/database-protocol/ ">Science Commons
                  Database Protocol FAQ</a>)</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Furthermore, Dryad’s use of CC0 to make the terms of reuse explicit has some important
            advantages: </p>
         <ul class="text-list">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interoperability:</span> Since CC0 is both human
               and machine-readable, other people and indexing services will automatically be able
               to determine the terms of use. </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Universality:</span> CC0 is a single mechanism that
               is both global and universal, covering all data and all countries. It is also widely
               recognized.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simplicity:</span> There is no need for humans to
               make, or respond to, individual data requests, and no need for click-through
               agreements. This allows more scientists to spend their time doing science. </li>
         </ul>
         <p>It is important to note that if you have data that, due to pre-existing agreements,
            cannot be released under the terms of CC0, please do not deposit that data to Dryad.
            Journals that require data archiving as a condition of publication can make exceptions
            for such special cases.</p>
         <a name="whatDOI"> </a>
 	      <h2>What is a Dryad DOI?</h2>
 	      <p>The data you deposit in Dryad are given
 	        a <a href="http://www.doi.org/faq.html#1">Digital Object
 	        Identifier</a>, or DOI. A DOI is a permanent, unique, and
 	        secure identifier. It should be used whenever referring to
 	        data in Dryad.</p>
 
	 <p>A Dryad DOI consists of letters and numbers like 
	   this: 10.5061/dryad.6h722</p>

 		 <p>Here are 3 important points about DOIs:</p> 
 		 <ul class="text-list">
 		   <li>A DOI is <b>much more stable than a URL</b>.  A URL may change over time.</li>
 		   <li>All data files in Dryad associated with a given
 		     article <b>are called a data package and have a single 
 		       DOI</b>. Data citation best practice is to use this DOI
 		     (<b>not</b> a page URL) when citing or referring others to
 		     the data.</li> 
 		   <li>Data files that have been archived in Dryad
 		     and assigned DOIs <b>can be cited</b> just like an article, listed
 		     in References, and included on CVs.</li> 
 		 </ul>
 
       <a name="howFormat"> </a> 
       <h2>How should I format a Dryad DOI?</h2> 
       <p>The DOI <b>should</b> be presented with the web prefix <a href="https://doi.org">https://doi.org</a>.</p>

       <p>Here is the recommended way to display the DOI:</p>
 		 <blockquote> 
 		   <p>Data deposited in the Dryad repository: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6h722">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6h722</a></p>
 		 </blockquote>
 
 		 <p>Copying and pasting the <b>page URL is not a stable or permanent</b> way to point to your data, as it does not contain the DOI and could change.</p>


       <a name="howRefer"> </a> 
 	    <h2>How do I refer to my Dryad data in my article?</h2>
 	    <p>The data files you deposit into Dryad are given a DOI.  A DOI is a permanent, unique, and secure identifier.  It should be used whenever referring to data in Dryad. </p>
  
 		 <p>If your data have been deposited into Dryad before your article is published, be sure to include the Dryad DOI in the article itself.  Providing the Dryad DOI will allow readers to easily find the underlying data, and facilitates a subsequent data citation.  Citations that include Dryad DOIs can be easily and accurately tracked, thereby improving the discoverability and recognition of your data and your article.</p>

       <a name="whereRefer"> </a>
 	    <h2>Where is the appropriate place in my journal article to refer to my data package?</h2> 
 	    <p>Data citation practices are actively evolving and vary considerably among journals.  Dryad does not have a recommendation for the placement of data citations at this time.  Some publishing organizations, such as <a
 	       href="http://www.crossref.org/10quarterly/quarterly.html#dois_in_use">CrossRef</a>, Springer and <a
 	       href="http://gigasciencejournal.com/authors/instructions/research#formatting-references">BioMed Central</a>, recommend reporting the data both in the text (e.g., within a Methods or a dedicated Data Resource section) and in the bibliography.
 	    </p>
         
       <p>An example of how to reference the data in the text would be:</p> 
 		 <blockquote> 
 		    <p>Data deposited in the Dryad repository: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.585t4">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.585t4</a></p>
 		 </blockquote>

       <p>An example of a full citation to the Heneghan et al. (2011) data package would be:</p>
 	       <blockquote>
 	          <p>Heneghan C, Thompson M, Billingsley M, Cohen, D (2011) Data from: Medical-device recalls in the UK and the device-regulation process: retrospective review of safety notices and alerts.
 	             Dryad Digital Respository. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.585t4">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.585t4</a></p>
 	       </blockquote>
         
         <p>Regardless of where the data citations are placed, it is important that the DOI be included.  Also note that while this may be written as 'doi:10.5061/dryad.585t4', the full URL address <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.585t4">'https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.585t4'</a> is generally preferred. </p>

 	    <a name="package"> </a>
       <h2>What is a data package?</h2>

 	    <p>The entire set of data files associated with one publication is called a data package and is assigned a DOI, and each individual data file within the data package is also given a component DOI.  When your data deposit is approved by the Dryad Curator, the DOI for your data package is sent to you by email. Please use the data package DOI when referring to your data, unless you are specifically making reference to a particular component data file.</p>
 
 		 <p>For example, the data package <a href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1888">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1888</a> contains two files, <b>NicSolstatus.csv</b> and <b>NicSolPLML.tre</b>.  Clicking through on each of these files to view their details, we can see that each one has its own Dryad file identifier DOI (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1888/1">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1888/1</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1888/2">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1888/2</a> respectively).  These component file data identifiers can be used when the files need to be referenced individually, rather than the data package as a whole. </p>
  
       <a name="viewStats"> </a>
       <h2>How can I see how often my data package is viewed and downloaded?</h2>
       <p>The Dryad repository records how many times your Dryad record has been viewed and your data files downloaded, and displays this information for every data package and its component data files.  Check back from time to time to watch your statistics increase.  (We’re filtering out  hits from search-engine robots and other automated services, so these numbers do represent real human usage.)   Examples of frequently downloaded data packages in Dryad:</p>

 	    <h2>How can I add my data package to a Data section on my CV?</h2>
 	    <p>You can add a <b>Data Publications</b> section to your CV to highlight that you have made your data widely accessible.  A complete data citation includes the reference to the original article <b>and</b> a reference to the data in Dryad, and both are displayed in Dryad for each data package, e.g.:</p>
