<head>Submitting Content to VSim</head>

<hi rend="bold">Who may submit content?</hi>

<p>Gosh, what a great question. When we have an answer for this, we will put it here.</p>

<hi rend="bold">Submitting files</hi>
<p>We should explain the nuts and bolts of how to submit a new model here, kind of like a focused mini-tour, just to outline the process</p>

<hi rend="bold">File types</hi>

<p>Most electronic formats can be placed in VSim. If we have specific guidance it can go here.</p>

<hi rend="bold">Previously published content</hi>

<p>Publishers may restrict your ability to include previously published content in an open access repository. 
    Contact us for help in determining the guidelines for specific journals and publishers.</p>

<hi rend="bold">Contact us</hi>

<p><xref target="/xmlui/pages/contact">Contact us</xref> if you 
    have questions about submitting content, preferred file formats, and publisher restrictions on 
    previously published material.</p>
