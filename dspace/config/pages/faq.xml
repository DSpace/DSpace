            <p> The Windows prototype version 1.2.1. is the version to use! Even if you are on a Mac, run this version on Parallels.</p>

            <hi rend="bold">When is the new version going to be released?</hi>
            <p> We are working on it. Check back for beta releases beginning May 2017.</p>

            <p> The model is probably beyond the far clip plane. Click Settings -> Navigation Settings and change the Far Clip from 5000 to 50000. If the model was built in inches or centimeters, you'll probably also want to change the Eye Height from 1.5 to something higher (20?) and the Flight Accel. Factor from 6 to something higher (160?) </p>

            <hi rend="bold">My students are building narratives for an assignment. Some of them use PCs, some use Macs... what fonts should I have them use?</hi>
            <p> There are only three fonts that cross the PC/Mac divide: Arial, Georgia, and Verdana. If your students are going to be sharing narratives, they must use those fonts for text to display properly.</p>
