<div id="what.is.mospace" n="whatis">
<head>What is MOspace?</head>
<p>
MOspace is the digital institutional repository of the University of Missouri System and is a joint initiative of the University libraries, the Office of Library Systems, and the Division of Information Technology. It is a permanent digital storehouse of research and knowledge focusing on works created by those connected with the University of Missouri.

</div>

<div id="why.is.mospace.important" n="whyimportant">
<head>Why is MOspace important?</head>
<p>
MOspace acts as a preservation tool and contributes to the international open access movement. Recent votes in favor of open access have passed in many institutions, including Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Stanford's School of Education.

</div>

<div id="how.is.mospace.different" n="howdifferent">
<head>How is MOspace different from a personal website?</head>
<p>
MOspace allows the library to preserve and provide open access to the items in a more permanent way than posting to a website. The use of DSpace software, an open source product developed at MIT, provides permanent URLs for documents deposited through it to the MOspace server.

</div>

<div id="who.can.access.mospace" n="whoaccess">
<head>Who can access MOspace?</head>
<p>
MOspace is open access, meaning anyone can view it from the open web. By providing free access to a rich body of work, MOspace promotes research and knowledge produced by the University of Missouri.

</div>

<div id="what.are.the.copyright.implications" n="copyright">
<head>What are the copyright implications of submitting to MOspace?</head>
<p>
MOspace encourages authors not to sign away rights to their own works, as often happens when they publish in commercial journals.  Retaining the copyright allows content to be made available to students and scholars without huge subscription fees.  In MOspace, the author/creator retains copyright in all cases, so an author could also publish an item elsewhere, providing that the publisher allows (see this <xref target="http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/completeonline.shtml">author's addendum</xref> for an example addendum to a publisher's contract).  For items not commercially published, author permission is all that is needed to allow the Library to add it to MOspace.

<head>What are the benefits of submitting works to MOspace?</head>
<p>
MOspace provides content with increased visibility, a permanent URL, a dedication to preservation, and full-text searchability.

<div id="how.to.cite" n="howtocite">
<head>How do I cite something I find in MOspace?</head>
<p>
Each item in MOspace has been assigned a "<xref target="#handles">handle</xref>," a persistent URL you can use when citing the item in publications or other communications. In most citation styles, you'll treat the MOspace item as an electronic publication.

<div id="search" n="search">
<head>How do I SEARCH MOspace?</head>
<p>
To search all of MOspace, use the search box at the top of the navigation bar on the left (or the search box in the middle of the home page).
</p>
<p>
<figure source="../static/images/help/searchtop.gif" />

<div id="what.is.searched" n="whatissearched">
<head>What is searched in the general keyword search?</head>
<p>
MOspace uses the <xref target="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">Apache Lucene</xref> search engine. Here are some search hints:
</p>
<p>
The word(s) you enter in the search box will be searched against the title, author, subject abstract, series, sponsor and identifier fields of each item's record.

</div>


<div id="what.is.not.searched" n="whatissearched">
<head>What is NOT searched (Stop Words)?</head>
<p>
The search engine ignores certain words that occur frequently in English, but do not add value to the search. These are:
</p>
<p>
"a", "and" , "are" , "as" , "at" , "be" , "but" , "by" , "for" , "if" , "in" , "into",

<p>[ <xref target="#top">back to top</xref> ]</p>
</div>


<div id="other.search.options" n="otheroptions">
<head>What other options do I have when constructing my search?</head>

<p><hi rend="bold">Truncation</hi> - Use an asterisk (*) after a word stem to get all hits having words starting with that root, for example:</p>
<p><figure source="../static/images/help/search1.gif"> select* </figure></p>
<p>will retrieve selects, selector, selectman, selecting.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Stemming</hi> - The search engine automatically expands words with common endings to include plurals, past tenses ...etc.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Phrase Searching</hi> - To search using multiple words as a phrase, put quotation marks (") around the phrase.</p>

<p><figure source="../static/images/help/search8.jpg"> "organizational change" </figure></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Exact word match</hi> - Put a plus (+) sign before a word if it MUST appear in the search result. For instance, in the following search the word "training" is optional, but the word "dog" must be in the result.
</p>
<p><figure source="../static/images/help/search2.gif"> +dog training </figure></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Eliminate items with unwanted words</hi> - Put a minus (-) sign before a word if it should not appear in the search results. Alternatively, you can use NOT. This can limit your search to eliminate unwanted hits. For instance, in the search
</p>
<p><figure source="../static/images/help/search3.jpg"> training -cat </figure> or <figure source="../static/images/help/search4.jpg"> training NOT cat </figure></p>

<p>you will get items containing the word "training", except those that also contain the word "cat".</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Boolean searching</hi> - The following Boolean operators can be used to combine terms. Note that they must be CAPITALIZED !</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">AND</hi> - to limit searches to find items containing all words or phrases combined with this operator, e.g.</p>
<p><figure source="../static/images/help/search5.jpg"> cats AND dogs </figure></p>
<p>will retrieve all items that contain BOTH the words "cats" and "dogs".</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">OR</hi> - to enlarge searches to find items containing any of the words or phrases surrounding this operator</p>
<p><figure source="../static/images/help/search6.jpg"> cats OR dogs </figure></p>
<p> will retrieve all items that contain EITHER the words "cats" or "dogs".</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">NOT</hi> - to exclude items containing the word following this operator, e.g.</p>
<p><figure source="../static/images/help/search4.jpg"> training NOT cat </figure></p>
<p>will retrieve all items that contain the word "training" EXCEPT those also containing the word "cat".</p>

<p>Parentheses can be used in the search query to group search terms into sets, and operators can then be applied to the whole set, e.g. </p>

You can restrict your search to a community by clicking on the arrow to the right of the top box. If you want your search to encompass all of DSpace, leave that box in the default position.

MOspace content is organized around Communities which can correspond to administrative entities such as schools, departments, labs and research centers. Within each community there can be an unlimited number subcommunities and an unlimited number of collections. Each collection may contain an unlimited number of items.

<div id="handles" n="handles">
<head>What are Handles?</head>
<p>
When your item becomes a part of the MOspace repository it is assigned a persistent URL. This means that, unlike most URLs, this identifier will not have to be changed when the system migrates to new hardware, or when changes are made to the system. MOspace is committed to maintaining the integrity of this identifier so that you can safely use it to refer to your item when citing it in publications or other communications. Our persistent urls are registered with the <xref target="http://www.handle.net/">Handle System</xref>, a comprehensive system for assigning, managing, and resolving persistent identifiers, known as "handles," for digital objects and other resources on the Internet. The Handle System is administered by the <xref target="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/">Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)</xref>, which undertakes, fosters, and promotes research in the public interest.
