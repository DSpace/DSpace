            <hi rend="bold">Why is VSim important?</hi>
            <p> The VSim Repository acts as a preservation tool and contributes to
                the international open access movement. VSim is our part of the international
                open access movement. For more information on open access, see <xref
                    target="http://www.sparc.arl.org/issues/open-access">the SPARC website</xref>. </p>
            <p> An important part of the VSim effort is encouraging authors not to sign away
                rights to their own works, as often happens when they publish in commercial
                journals. Retaining the copyright allows content to be made available to students
                and scholars without huge subscription fees. In VSim, the author/creator retains
                copyright in all cases, so an author could also publish an item elsewhere, providing
                that the publisher allows (see this <xref
                    target="http://www.sparc.arl.org/resource/complete-sparc-author-addendum-online"

                publisher's contract). </p>

            <p> VSim allows the library to preserve and provide open access to the items in a
                more permanent way than posting to a website. The use of DSpace software, an open
                source product developed at MIT, provides permanent URLs for resources. </p>

                by the University of Missouri. </p>

            <p> VSim encourages authors not to sign away rights to their own works, as often
                happens when they publish in commercial journals. Retaining the copyright allows
                content to be made available to students and scholars without huge subscription
                fees. In VSim, if you are the copyright holder, you retain the copyright in all
                cases, so that you can publish elsewhere, providing that the publisher allows such
                publishing. See this <xref

                needed to allow us to add it to VSim. </p>

            <p> You have more than one option. You may use a keyword search, which will search for
                the words you enter anywhere in the indexed fields. If you have a specific title or
                author, try a browse search. The word(s) you enter will be searched from the
                beginning of indexed fields. Keyword searches are a useful way to start if you don’t
                have a specific author or title in mind or aren’t sure of the author’s name or the
                exact title. These two types of searches are discussed in more detail below. </p>
            <p> To limit your search to a specific community or collection, navigate to that
                community or collection and use the search bar on that page. </p>

            <p>The third option allows you to specify the field you wish to search and to include

                choosing, “Does Not Contain.” This will help to exclude items that are not relevant

            <hi rend="bold">How do I limit search results and use facets</hi>
            <p> VSim uses facets to modify search results in the institutional repository. You
                will see the different enabled facets displayed in a "Discover" section in your
                sidebar, by default, right below the Browse options. Applying a facet normally
                reduces the original search results. Many facets can be applied on the home page but
                generally they are applied after an initial search. Facets show counts for each
                value and allow the user to "drill down" or further restrict their search results
                based on those facets</p>
            <p>Our sidebar facets are: <list n="filetypes" id="file.help.list.filetypes"
                    type="bulleted">
                    <item>Format</item>
                    <item>Subject</item>
                    <item>Date Issued</item>
                    <item>Author</item>
                    <item>Author/Contributor</item>
                    <item>Subect: Time Period</item>
                    <item>Subject: Place</item>
                    <item>Advisor</item>
                    <item>Thesis Department</item>
                    <item>Thesis Semester</item>
                    <item>Language</item>
                </list>
            </p>
            <p> It's important to know that multiple metadata fields can be included in one facet.
                An important feature of the facets is that their contents are automatically updated
                based on the context of the page. </p>
            <p> When using a keyword search in Advanced Search, you can limit your search results
                using the options under “Keyword search by field.” On the Advanced Search page, you
                can access these by choosing, “Search or Limit by Field.” This gives you the option
                to search for or exclude words in selected fields. After executing a keyword search,
                you can further limit the search results by using facets, as described above. </p>

            <hi rend="bold">What are Communities and Collections?</hi>
            <p> VSim content is organized around Communities and Sub-communities which correspond
                to administrative units such as schools, departments, labs, and research centers.
                Content in these are organized under collections. Communities, Sub-communities, and
                Collections have an entry page that may include information on that community or
                collection. </p>
            <p> Collections can be organized around a topic, or by type of information (such as
                working papers or datasets) or by any other sorting method a community finds useful
                in organizing its digital items. </p>

            <hi rend="bold">What are Handles?</hi>
            <p> VSim items have persistent URLs. There URLs are considered persistent, because
                they are registered with the <xref target="http://www.handle.net/">Handle
                    System</xref>, a comprehensive system for assigning, managing, and resolving
                persistent identifiers. The use of handles means that, unlike most URLs, this
                identifier will not have to be changed when the system migrates to new hardware, or
                when changes are made to the system. </p>
            <p>You will note that each item has two URLs associated with it. Use the handle to
                ensure persistence. <list n="filetypes" id="file.help.list.filetypes"
