        This section configures the Aspect "chain". An Aspect provides a set 
        of coupled features for the system. All Aspects are chained together
        such that together they form the complete DSpace website. This is where
        the chain is defined, the order in which each aspect is declared 
        determines it's order in the chain. Aspects at the top are invoked 
        first. 
        
        The <aspect> element has two attributes, name & path. The name is used 
        to identify the Aspect, while the path determines the directory. The 
        path attribute should be listed exactly as it is found in the
        /xmlui/cocoon/aspects/ directory followed by a slash.
    -->
    <aspects>
        <aspect name="Artifact Browser" path="resource://aspects/ArtifactBrowser/" />
        <aspect name="Administration" path="resource://aspects/Administrative/" />
        <aspect name="E-Person" path="resource://aspects/EPerson/" />
        <aspect name="Submission and Workflow" path="resource://aspects/Submission/" />

        <!-- 
            This aspect tests the various possible DRI features, 
            it helps a theme developer create themes 
        -->
        <!-- <aspect name="XML Tests" path="resource://aspects/XMLTest/"/> -->
    </aspects>

    <!--
        This section configures which Theme should apply to a particular URL. 
        Themes stylize an abstract DRI document (generated by the Aspect
        chain from above) and produce XHTML (or possibly another format) for 
        display to the user. Each theme rule is processed in the order that it 
        is listed below, the first rule that matches is the theme that is applied.
        
        The <theme> element has several attributes including: name, id, regex, 
        handle, and path. The name attribute is used to identify the theme, while
        the path determines the directory. The path attribute should be listed 
        exactly as it is found in the /xmlui/cocoon/themes/ directory. Both the
        regex and handle attributes determine if the theme rule matches the URL.
        If either the pattern or handle attribute is left off then the only the 
        other component is used to determine matching. 
        
        Keep in mind that the order of <theme> elements matters in the case of 
        overlapping matching rules. For example, a theme rule with a very broad
        matching rule (like regex=".*") will override a more specific theme 
        declaration (like handle="1234/23") if placed before it. 
        
        Finally, theme application also "cascades" down to pages derived from the
        one that the theme directly applies to. Thus, a theme applied to a 
        specific community will also apply to that community's collections and 
        their respective items.

        <!-- <theme name="Test Theme 2" regex="community-list" path="theme2/"/> -->

        <!-- Default theme -->
        <theme name="Default Reference Theme" regex=".*" path="Reference/" />

        <!-- Classic theme, inspired by the JSP UI -->
        <!-- <theme name="Classic" regex=".*" path="Classic/" /> -->
