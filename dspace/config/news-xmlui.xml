<p><hi rend="bold">Explore. Interact. Understand.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">VSim</hi> is a simple-to-use interface for exploring computer models of historic sites and environments. Designed to support both teacher-centered presentations and student-centered assignments, this NEH-funded software is perfect for classroom use.</p>
<p>The VSim interface is flexible, and can fit into any classroom. It includes two critical features for teaching and learning: the <hi rend="bold">narrative</hi> function allows users to create linear presentations (think PowerPoint or Prezi within a three-dimensional world), and the <hi rend="bold">embedded resource</hi> function allows users to annotate the virtual space and embed links to primary and secondary resources within the modeled environment.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="bold">VSim Repository and Archive</hi> preserves academically generated models for use in both formal and informal educational settings. Scholars across the country have constructed these models to exacting standards, so they are ideal teaching and learning resources. To contribute models to the VSim Repository and Archive, create a user account and request an upgrade to content creator status.</p>
