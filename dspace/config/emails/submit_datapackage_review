Thank you for submitting your data package to Dryad for journal review. Please read the following information carefully and save it for future reference. 

(1) Your data package is temporarily available to journal editors and reviewers via a private review link (see below).

(2) It has been assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), but this DOI will not work until/unless your manuscript is accepted for publication and your data package is approved by our curators.

(3) If/when your manuscript is accepted, please make sure that the DOI, and NOT the review link, is included in the published article. More information about citing your data is below. 

(4) If you need to modify your submission, please see the instructions below. Do not create multiple Dryad submissions associated with the same manuscript.

(5) If you were asked to enter a credit card number, your card will not be charged unless/until your manuscript is accepted and your submission is approved. You will receive a confirmation when your card is charged.

(for inclusion in the published article)


MODIFYING YOUR DRYAD SUBMISSION

Should you need to modify your data package while it is in review, you may access it at https://datadryad.org/submissions. Do not create multiple Dryad submissions associated with the same manuscript.

The actions you can perform while a submission is in review are limited. Since article titles, authors, and abstracts often change during the publication process, we will confirm and update this information if/when the manuscript is accepted and published.

Dryad does not allow files to be deleted while a manuscript is under review. We only allow additions during this time. This restriction ensures that reviewers see the files that were originally submitted.

To add new or corrected files:
  - Go to https://datadryad.org/submissions and log in. 
  - Select the appropriate data package. At the bottom of the page for this package, you will see an option to "Add new data file".
  - After you have finished adding data files, please send an email to help@datadryad.org (including your Dryad DOI) to indicate which files should be retained during the final curation process.

If/when your manuscript is accepted, Dryad curators will remove any files that you have indicated are duplicate or superseded. Your Dryad submission will automatically move into our queue for curation and archiving, and will no longer be accessible for modification. Should you need to make changes to the data after that point, please contact us at help@datadryad.org.


CITING YOUR DRYAD DATA

Ensure that readers can find your data!

We recommend that the article include a link to the Dryad data as follows:

Data available from the Dryad Digital Repository: {7}

Your journal may follow the CrossRef recommendation that the data package be cited in the article Reference list. If so, the citation should include the Dryad package DOI, e.g.:

Author(s) (Year). {0}. Dryad Digital Repository. {1}


Please email us at help@datadryad.org if you have questions.

Many thanks!
