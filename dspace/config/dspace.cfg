#---------------------------------------------------------------#
#------------------GENERAL CONFIGURATIONS-----------------------#
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
# These configs are used by underlying DSpace API, and are      #
# therefore applicable to all interfaces                        #
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
##### Basic information ######

# DSpace installation directory
dspace.dir = ${default.dspace.dir}

# DSpace host name - should match base URL.  Do not include port number
dspace.hostname = ${default.dspace.hostname}

# DSpace base host URL.  Include port number etc.
dspace.baseUrl = http://${dspace.hostname}

# DSpace port (needed for logo display)
dspace.port = ${default.dspace.port}

# DSpace base URL.  Include port number etc., but NOT trailing slash
# Change to xmlui if you wish to use the xmlui as the default, or remove
dspace.url = ${default.dspace.url}

# The base URL of the OAI webapp (do not include /request).
dspace.oai.url = ${dspace.baseUrl}/oai

# Name of the site
dspace.name = Dryad Data Repository

# The home of this particular instance (UK or NCSU)
dryad.home = ${default.dryad.home}

# Whether links (that can be) should be localized
dryad.localize = ${default.dryad.localize}

##### Database settings #####

# Database name ("oracle", or "postgres")
db.name = postgres

# URL for connecting to database
db.url = ${default.db.url}

# JDBC Driver
db.driver = org.postgresql.Driver

# Database username and password
db.username = ${default.db.username}
db.password = ${default.db.password}

# Connection pool parameters

# Maximum number of DB connections in pool
db.maxconnections = 300

# Maximum time to wait before giving up if all connections in pool are busy (milliseconds)
db.maxwait = 10000

# Maximum number of idle connections in pool (-1 = unlimited)
# Set to 100 by dleehr 2014-08-04.  Previously unlimited.
# Limiting idle connections should limit idle postgres processes on server
db.maxidle = 100

# Determine if prepared statement should be cached. (default is true)
db.statementpool = false

# Specify a name for the connection pool (useful if you have multiple applications sharing Tomcat's dbcp)
# If not specified, defaults to 'dspacepool'
# db.poolname = dspacepool

##### Email settings ######

# SMTP mail server
mail.server = ${default.mail.server}

# SMTP mail server authentication username and password (if required)
mail.server.username = ${default.mail.server.username}
mail.server.password = ${default.mail.server.password}

# SMTP mail server alternate port (defaults to 25)
# mail.server.port = 25

# From address for mail
mail.from.address = ${default.mail.help}

# Currently limited to one recipient!
feedback.recipient = ${default.mail.help}

# General site administration (Webmaster) e-mail
mail.admin = ${default.mail.admin}

# Recipient for server errors and alerts
alert.recipient = ${mail.admin}

# Recipient for new user registration emails
registration.notify = ${mail.admin}

# Recipient for mailing list subscription emails
subscribe_mailinglist.recipient = ${default.subscribe_mailinglist.recipient}

# Recipient for Membership Application emails
membership.recipient = ${default.membership.recipient}

# Set the default mail character set. This may be over ridden by providing a line
# inside the email template "charset: <encoding>", otherwise this default is used.
mail.charset = UTF8

# A comma separated list of hostnames that are allowed to refer browsers to email forms.
# Default behaviour is to accept referrals only from dspace.hostname
#mail.allowed.referrers = localhost

# Pass extra settings to the Java mail library. Comma separated, equals sign between
# the key and the value.
mail.extraproperties = ${default.mail.extraproperties}

# An option is added to disable the mailserver. By default, this property is set to false
# By setting mail.server.disabled = true, DSpace will not send out emails.
# It will instead log the subject of the email which should have been sent
# This is especially useful for development and test environments where production data is used when testing functionality.
#mail.server.disabled = false

# Default language for metadata values
# Setting this to "blank", since it is silly to assume a language
# when we're getting input from many different types of submitters
# and some of the input is numeric, which doesn't have a language!
default.language =


##### File Storage ######

# Asset (bitstream) store number 0 (zero)
assetstore.dir = ${dspace.dir}/assetstore

# Specify extra asset stores like this, counting from 1 upwards:
# assetstore.dir.1 = /second/assetstore
# assetstore.dir.2 = /third/assetstore

# Specify the number of the store to use for new bitstreams with this property
# The default is 0 (zero) which corresponds to the 'assetstore.dir' above
# assetstore.incoming = 1


##### SRB File Storage #####

# The same 'assetstore.incoming' property is used to support the use of SRB
# (Storage Resource Broker - see http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/) as an _optional_
# replacement of or supplement to conventional file storage. DSpace will work
# with or without SRB and full backward compatibility is maintained.
#
# The 'assetstore.incoming' property is an integer that references where _new_
# bitstreams will be stored.  The default (say the starting reference) is zero.
# The value will be used to identify the storage where all new bitstreams will
# be stored until this number is changed.  This number is stored in the
# Bitstream table (store_number column) in the DSpace database, so older
# bitstreams that may have been stored when 'asset.incoming' had a different
# value can be found.
#
# In the simple case in which DSpace uses local (or mounted) storage the
# number can refer to different directories (or partitions).  This gives DSpace
# some level of scalability.  The number links to another set of properties
# 'assetstore.dir', 'assetstore.dir.1' (remember zero is default),
# 'assetstore.dir.2', etc., where the values are directories.
#
# To support the use of SRB DSpace uses this same scheme but broadened to
# support:
# - using SRB instead of the local filesystem
# - using the local filesystem (native DSpace)
# - using a mix of SRB and local filesystem
#
# In this broadened use the 'asset.incoming' integer will refer one of the
# following storage locations
# - a local filesystem directory (native DSpace)
# - a set of SRB account parameters (host, port, zone, domain, username,
#       password, home directory, and resource)
#
# Should the be any conflict, like '2' refering to a local directory and
# to a set of SRB parameters, the program will select the local directory.
#
# If SRB is chosen from the first install of DSpace, it is suggested that
# 'assetstore.dir' (no integer appended) be retained to reference a local
# directory (as above under File Storage) because build.xml uses this value
# to do a mkdir. In this case, 'assetstore.incoming' can be set to 1 (i.e.
# uncomment the line in File Storage above) and the 'assetstore.dir' will not
# be used.
#
# Here is an example set of SRB parameters:
# Assetstore 1 - SRB
#srb.host.1 = mysrbmcathost.myu.edu
#srb.port.1 = 5544
#srb.mcatzone.1 = mysrbzone
#srb.mdasdomainname.1 = mysrbdomain
#srb.defaultstorageresource.1 = mydefaultsrbresource
#srb.username.1 = mysrbuser
#srb.password.1 = mysrbpassword
#srb.homedirectory.1 = /mysrbzone/home/mysrbuser.mysrbdomain
#srb.parentdir.1 = mysrbdspaceassetstore
#
# Assetstore n, n+1, ...
# Follow same pattern as for assetstores above (local or SRB)


##### Logging configuration #####
# These settings are currently NOT used by the XMLUI.
# The XMLUI writes its logs to the '[dspace-xmlui]/WEB-INF/logs/'
# in the actual XMLUI web application.

# Override default log4j configuration
# you may provide your own configuration here, existing
# alternatives are:

# log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j-console.properties
log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j.properties

# Where to put the logs (used in configuration only)
log.dir = ${dspace.dir}/log

# If enabled, the logging and the solr statistics system will look for
# an X-Forward header. If it finds it, it will use this for the user IP Address
# useProxies = true
useProxies = true


##### Search settings #####

# Where to put search index files
search.dir = ${dspace.dir}/search

# Higher values of search.max-clauses will enable prefix searches to work on
# large repositories
# search.max-clauses = 2048

# Which Lucene Analyzer implementation to use.  If this is omitted or
# commented out, the standard DSpace analyzer (designed for English)
# is used by default.
# search.analyzer = org.dspace.search.DSAnalyzer

# Chinese analyzer
# search.analyzer = org.apache.lucene.analysis.cn.ChineseAnalyzer

# Boolean search operator to use, current supported values are OR and AND
# If this config item is missing or commented out, OR is used
# AND requires all search terms to be present
# OR requires one or more search terms to be present
search.operator = AND


##### Search indexing settings #####

# Maximum number of terms indexed for a single field in Lucene.
# Default is 10,000 words - often not enough for full-text indexing.
# If you change this, you'll need to re-index for the change
# to take effect on previously added items.
# -1 = unlimited (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
search.maxfieldlength = 10000


##### Fields to Index for Search #####

# DC metadata elements.qualifiers to be indexed for search
# format: - search.index.[number] = [search field]:element.qualifier
#         - * used as wildcard

###      changing these will change your search results,     ###
###  but will NOT automatically change your search displays  ###

search.index.1 = author:dc.contributor.*
search.index.2 = author:dc.creator.*
search.index.3 = title:dc.title.*
search.index.4 = keyword:dc.subject.*
search.index.5 = abstract:dc.description.abstract
search.index.6 = author:dc.description.statementofresponsibility
search.index.7 = series:dc.relation.ispartofseries
search.index.8 = abstract:dc.description.tableofcontents
search.index.9 = mime:dc.format.mimetype

search.index.16 = taxon:dwc.ScientificName
search.index.17 = type:dc.type
# kind is _required_ for Dryad search enhancements to work
search.index.18 = kind:dc.type

##### Fields to Display in Advanced Search #####
# Any fields listed here need to be defined as indexes above.
# Otherwise, searches will produce no results.
search.advanced.display.1 = title
search.advanced.display.2 = author
search.advanced.display.3 = keyword
search.advanced.display.4 = identifier
search.advanced.display.5 = description
search.advanced.display.6 = taxon


##### Handle settings ######

# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# By default, DSpace is configured to use http://hdl.handle.net/
# as the canonical URL prefix when generating dc.identifier.uri
# during submission, and in the 'identifier' displayed in JSPUI
# item record pages.
#
# If you do not subscribe to CNRI's handle service, you can change this
# to match the persistent URL service you use, or you can force DSpace
# to use your site's URL, eg.
#handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.url}/handle/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifer.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions), but it will alter the URL
# in JSPUI's 'identifier' message on item record pages for existing items.
#
# If omitted, the canonical URL prefix will be http://hdl.handle.net/
handle.canonical.prefix = http://hdl.handle.net/

# CNRI Handle prefix
handle.prefix = 10255

# Directory for installing Handle server files
handle.dir = ${dspace.dir}/handle-server

##### DOI settings #####

doi.hostname = http://dx.doi.org

# Don't want to use ${dspace.url} b/c that will vary across instances
dryad.url = http://datadryad.org

doi.prefix = ${default.doi.prefix}

doi.service.url = ${default.doi.service}

doi.service.testmode= ${default.doi.testmode}

doi.dir = ${dspace.dir}/doi-minter

doi.username = dryad

doi.password = ${default.doi.password}

doi.suffix.length = 5

doi.localpart.suffix = dryad.

# According to http://ezid.cdlib.org/demo/advanced, a test DOI should have the prefix 10.5072 and suffix FK2xxxxx.
doi.testprefix = 10.5072

doi.localpart.testsuffix = FK2dryad.

# For dev and testing, don't want to hit them all the time
doi.datacite.connected = ${default.doi.datacite.connected}

#### Stackable Authentication Methods #####

# Stack of authentication methods
#  (See org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationManager)
# Example:
# plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = \
#       org.dspace.authenticate.ShibAuthentication, \
#        org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication
plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = \
        org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication,  \
        org.dspace.authenticate.OAuthAuthenticationMethod

#### Shibboleth Authentication Configuration Settings ####
# Check https://mams.melcoe.mq.edu.au/zope/mams/pubs/Installation/dspace15/view
# for installation detail.
#
# DSpace requires email as user's credential. There are 2 ways of providing
# email to DSpace:
# 1) by explicitly specifying to the user which attribute (header)
#    carries the email address.
# 2) by turning on the user-email-using-tomcat=true which means
#    the software will try to acquire the user's email from Tomcat
# The first option takes PRECEDENCE when specified. Both options can
# be enabled to allow fallback.

# this option below specifies that the email comes from the mentioned header.
# The value is CASE-Sensitive.
authentication.shib.email-header = MAIL

# optional. Specify the header that carries user's first name
# this is going to be used for creation of new-user
authentication.shib.firstname-header = SHIB-EP-GIVENNAME

# optional. Specify the header that carries user's last name
# this is used for creation of new user
authentication.shib.lastname-header = SHIB-EP-SURNAME

# this option below forces the software to acquire the email from Tomcat.
authentication.shib.email-use-tomcat-remote-user = true

# should we allow new users to be registered automtically
# if the IdP provides sufficient info (and user not exists in DSpace)
authentication.shib.autoregister = true

# these two header here specify which attribute that is responsible
# for providing user's roles to DSpace and unscope the attributes if needed.
# When not specified, it is defaulted to 'Shib-EP-UnscopedAffiliation', and
# ignore-scope is defaulted to 'false'.
# The value is specified in AAP.xml (Shib 1.3.x) or
# attribute-filter.xml (Shib 2.x). The value is CASE-Sensitive.
# The values provided in this header are separated by semi-colon or comma.
# If your sp only provides scoped role header, you need to set
# authentication.shib.role-header.ignore-Scope as true.
# for example if you only get Shib-EP-ScopedAffiliation instead of Shib-EP-ScopedAffiliation,
# you have to  make your setting as:
# authentication.shib.role-header = Shib-EP-ScopedAffiliation
# authentication.shib.role-header.ignore-scope = true

# authentication.shib.role-header = Shib-EP-UnscopedAffiliation
authentication.shib.role-header.ignore-scope = false

# when user is fully authN on IdP but would not like to release
# his/her roles to DSpace (for privacy reason?), what should be
# the default roles be given to such users?
# The values are separated by semi-colon or comma
# authentication.shib.default-roles = Staff, Walk-ins

# The following mappings specify role mapping between IdP and Dspace.
# the left side of the entry is IdP's role (prefixed with
# "authentication.shib.role.") which will be mapped to
# the right entry from DSpace. DSpace's group as indicated on the
# right entry has to EXIST in DSpace, otherwise user will be identified
# as 'anonymous'. Multiple values on the right entry should be separated
# by comma. The values are CASE-Sensitive. Heuristic one-to-one mapping
# will be done when the IdP groups entry are not listed below (i.e.
# if "X" group in IdP is not specified here, then it will be mapped
# to "X" group in DSpace if it exists, otherwise it will be mapped
# to simply 'anonymous')
#
# Given sufficient demand, future release could support regex for the mapping
# special characters need to be escaped by \
authentication.shib.role.Senior\ Researcher = Researcher, Staff
authentication.shib.role.Librarian = Administrator

#### PasswordAuthentication options ####

# Only emails ending in the following domains are allowed to self-register
# Example - example.com domain : @example.com
# Example - MIT domain and all .ac.uk domains: @mit.edu, .ac.uk
# authentication.password.domain.valid = example.com

##### Password users group #####

# If required, a group name can be given here, and all users who log in
# using the DSpace password system will automatically become members of
# this group. This is useful if you want a group made up of all internal
# authenticated users.
#password.login.specialgroup = group-name


#### Example of configuring X.509 authentication
#### (to use add org.dspace.authenticate.X509Authentication to auth stack above)

## method 1, using keystore
#authentication.x509.keystore.path = /tomcat/conf/keystore
#authentication.x509.keystore.password = changeit

## method 2, using CA certificate
#authentication.x509.ca.cert = ${dspace.dir}/config/MyClientCA.pem

## Create e-persons for unknown names in valid certificates?
#authentication.x509.autoregister = true

## Allow Certificate auth to show as a choice in chooser
# Use Messages.properties key for title
#authentication.x509.chooser.title.key=org.dspace.eperson.X509Authentication.title
#
# Identify the location of the Certificate Login Servlet.
#authentication.x509.chooser.uri=/certificate-login

#### Example of configuring IP-based authentication
#### (to use, add org.dspace.authenticate.IPAuthentication to auth stack above)
#
# authentication.ip.GROUPNAME = iprange[, iprange ...]
#
# Note if the Groupname contains blanks you must escape it,
# e.g. Department\ of\ Statistics
#
# Full, partial IPs; network/netmask; network/CIDR
#
#authentication.ip.MY_UNIVERSITY = 10.1.2.3, \
#                                  13.5, \
#                                  11.3.4.5/24, \
#                                  12.7.8.9/255.255.128.0


#### LDAP Authentication Configuration Settings ####
#
# If LDAP is enabled, then new users will be able to register
# by entering their username and  password without being sent the
# registration token. If users do not have a username and password,
# then they  can still register and login with just their email address
# the same way they do now.
#
# For providing any special privileges to LDAP users,
# you will still need to extend the SiteAuthenticator class to
# automatically put people who have a netid into a special
# group.  You might also want to give certain email addresses
# special privileges. Refer to the DSpace documentation for more
# information about how to do this.
#
# It may be necessary to obtain the values of these settings from the
# LDAP server administrators as LDAP configuration will vary from server
# to server.

# This setting will enable or disable LDAP authentication in DSpace.
# With the setting off, users will be required to register and login with
# their email address.  With this setting on, users will be able to login
# and register with their LDAP user ids and passwords.
# This setting is only used by the JSPUI.
ldap.enable = false

# This is the url to the institution's ldap server. The /o=myu.edu
# may or may not be required depending on the LDAP server setup.
# A server may also require the ldaps:// protocol.
#ldap.provider_url = ldap://ldap.myu.edu/o=myu.edu

# This is the unique identifier field in the LDAP directory
# where the username is stored.
#ldap.id_field = uid

# This is the object context used when authenticating the
# user.  It is appended to the ldap.id_field and username.
# For example uid=username,ou=people,o=myu.edu.  This must match
# the LDAP server configuration.
#ldap.object_context = ou=people,o=myu.edu

# This is the search context used when looking up a user's
# LDAP object to retrieve their data for autoregistering.
# With ldap.autoregister turned on, when a user authenticates
# without an EPerson object, a search on the LDAP directory to
# get their name and email address is initiated so that DSpace
# can create a EPerson object for them.  So after we have authenticated against
# uid=username,ou=people,o=byu.edu we now search in ou=people
# for filtering on [uid=username].  Often the
# ldap.search_context is the same as the ldap.object_context
# parameter.  But again this depends on each individual LDAP server
# configuration.
#ldap.search_context = ou=people

# This is the LDAP object field where the user's email address
# is stored.  "mail" is the default and the most common for
# LDAP servers.  If the mail field is not found the username
# will be used as the email address when creating the eperson
# object.
#ldap.email_field = mail

# This is the LDAP object field where the user's last name is
# stored.  "sn" is the default and is the most common for LDAP
# servers.  If the field is not found the field will be left
# blank in the new eperson object.
#ldap.surname_field = sn

# This is the LDAP object field where the user's given names
# are stored.  This may not be used or set in all LDAP instances.
# If the field is not found the field will be left blank in the
# new eperson object.
#ldap.givenname_field = givenName

# This is the field where the user's phone number is stored in
# the LDAP directory.  If the field is not found the field
# will be left blank in the new eperson object.
#ldap.phone_field = telephoneNumber

##### LDAP AutoRegister Settings #####

# This will turn LDAP autoregistration on or off.  With this
# on, a new EPerson object will be created for any user who
# successfully authenticates against the LDAP server when they
# first login.  With this setting off, the user
# must first register to get an EPerson object by
# entering their ldap username and password and filling out
# the forms.
webui.ldap.autoregister = true


##### LDAP users group #####

# If required, a group name can be given here, and all users who log in
# to LDAP will automatically become members of this group. This is useful
# if you want a group made up of all internal authenticated users.
#ldap.login.specialgroup = group-name


##### Hierarchical LDAP Settings #####

# If your users are spread out across a hierarchical tree on your
# LDAP server, you will need to use the following stackable authentication
# class:
#  plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = \
#        org.dspace.authenticate.LDAPHierarchicalAuthentication
#
# You can optionally specify the search scope. If anonymous access is not
# enabled on your LDAP server, you will need to specify the full DN and
# password of a user that is allowed to bind in order to search for the
# users.

# This is the search scope value for the LDAP search during
# autoregistering. This will depend on your LDAP server setup.
# This value must be one of the following integers corresponding
# to the following values:
# object scope : 0
# one level scope : 1
# subtree scope : 2
#ldap.search_scope = 2

# The full DN and password of a user allowed to connect to the LDAP server
# and search for the DN of the user trying to log in. If these are not specified,
# the initial bind will be performed anonymously.
#ldap.search.user = cn=admin,ou=people,o=myu.edu
#ldap.search.password = password

# If your LDAP server does not hold an email address for a user, you can use
# the following field to specify your email domain. This value is appended
# to the netid in order to make an email address. E.g. a netid of 'user' and
# ldap.netid_email_domain as '@example.com' would set the email of the user
# to be 'user@example.com
#ldap.netid_email_domain = @example.com


#### Restricted item visibilty settings ###
# By default RSS feeds, OAI-PMH and subscription emails will include ALL items
# regardless of permissions set on them.
#
# If you wish to only expose items through these channels where the ANONYMOUS
# user is granted READ permission, then set the following options to false
#
# Warning: In large repositories, setting harvest.includerestricted.oai to false may cause
# performance problems as all items will need to have their authorization permissions checked,
# but because DSpace has not implemented resumption tokens in ListIdentifiers, ALL items will
# need checking whenever a ListIdentifers request is made.
#
#harvest.includerestricted.rss = true
#harvest.includerestricted.oai = true
#harvest.includerestricted.subscription = true


#### Proxy Settings ######
# uncomment and specify both properties if proxy server required
# proxy server for external http requests - use regular hostname without port number
#http.proxy.host =

# port number of proxy server
#http.proxy.port =


#### Media Filter / Format Filter plugins (through PluginManager) ####
# Media/Format Filters help to full-text index content or
# perform automated format conversions

#
# This form represent a unique index of metadata values from the item.
#
# (date | title | text | <other>) refers to the datatype of the field.
#                       date: the index type will be treated as a date object
#                       title: the index type will be treated like a title, which will include
#                                       a link to the item page
#                       text: the index type will be treated as plain text.  If single mode is
#                                       specified then this will link to the full mode list
#           <other>: any other datatype will be treated the same as 'text', although
#                   it will apply any custom ordering normalisation configured below
#
#   The final part of the configuration is optional, and specifies the default ordering
#   for the index - whether it is ASCending (the default, and best for text indexes), or
#   DESCending (useful for dates - ie. most recent submissions)
#
#   NOTE: the text to render the index will use the <index name> parameter to select
#   the message key from Messages.properties using a key of the form:
#
# browse.type.metadata.<index name>
#
# The other form is for indexes of the items themselves, ie. each entry will be displayed
# according to the configuration of by webui.itemlist.columns:
#
# webui.browse.index.<n> = <index name> : item : <sort option name> : (asc | desc)
#
# sort option name: this is the sorting to be applied to the display. It must match the
#                   name given to one of the webui.itemlist.sort-option entries given below.
#
#   The final part of the configuration is optional, and specifies the default ordering
#   for the index - whether it is ASCending (the default, and best for text indexes), or
#   DESCending (useful for dates - ie. most recent submissions)

#   NOTE: the text to render the index will use the <sort option name> parameter to select
#   the message key from Messages.properties (for JSPUI) using a key of the form:
#
# browse.type.item.<sort option name>
#
# Note: the index numbers <n> must start from 1 and increment continuously by 1
# thereafter.  Deviation from this will cause an error during install or
# configuration update
#
# For compatibility with previous versions:
#
webui.browse.index.1 = dateissued:item:dateissued
webui.browse.index.2 = author:metadata:dc.contributor.*:text
#webui.browse.index.3 = title:item:title
#webui.browse.index.4 = subject:metadata:dc.subject.*:text

# Set the options for what can be sorted by
#
# Sort options will be available when browsing a list of items (i.e. an 'item' browse,
# or search results).  You can define an arbitrary number of fields
# to sort on, irrespective of which fields you display using webui.itemlist.columns
#
# the format is:
#
# webui.itemlist.sort-option.<n> = <option name> : \
#                                                                       <schema prefix>.<element>[.<qualifier>|.*] : \
#                                                                       (date | text | ...) : (show | hide)
#
# This is defined much the same as above.  The parameter after the metadata
# just lets the sorter know which normalisation to use - standard normalisations are title,
# text or date - however additional normalisations can be defined using the PluginManager.
#
# The final parts of the configuration is optional -  whether to SHOW (the default) or
# HIDE the option from the sorting controls in the user interface. This can be useful if
# you need to define a specific date sort for use by the recent items lists,
# but otherwise don't want users to choose that option.
#
webui.itemlist.sort-option.1 = title:dc.title:title
webui.itemlist.sort-option.2 = dateissued:dc.date.issued:date
webui.itemlist.sort-option.3 = dateaccessioned:dc.date.accessioned:date

# By default, the display of metadata in the browse indexes is case sensitive
# So, you will get seperate entries for the terms
#
#   Olive oil
#   olive oil
#
# However, clicking through from either of these will result in the same set of items
# (ie. any item that contains either representation in the correct field).
#
# Uncommenting the option below will make the metadata items case-insensitive. This will
# result in a single entry in the example above. However the value displayed may be either 'Olive oil'
# or 'olive oil' - depending on what representation was present in the first item indexed.
#
# If you care about the display of the metadata in the browse index - well, you'll have to go and
# fix the metadata in your items.
#
# webui.browse.metadata.case-insensitive = true

# Set the options for the size (number of characters) of the fields stored in the database.
#
# The default is 0, which is unlimited size for fields holding indexed data.  Some
# database implementations (e.g. Oracle) will enforce their own limit on this field
# size. Reducing the field size will decrease the potential size of your database and
# increase the speed of the browse, but it will also increase the chance of
# mis-ordering of similar fields.  Below are commented out, but proposed values for
# reasonably performance versus result quality
#
# Size of field for the browse value (this will affect display, and value sorting)
#
# webui.browse.value_columns.max = 500

#
# webui.browse.sort_columns.max = 200

# Omission mark to place after truncated strings in display.  The default is "..."
#
# webui.browse.value_columns.omission_mark = ...

# Set the options for how the indexes are sorted
#
# All sort normalisations are carried out by the OrderFormatDelegate.
# The plugin manager can be used to specify your own delegates for each datatype.
#
# The default datatypes (and delegates) are:
#
# author = org.dspace.sort.OrderFormatAuthor
# title  = org.dspace.sort.OrderFormatTitle
# text   = org.dspace.sort.OrderFormatText
#
# If you redefine a default datatype here, the configuration will be used in preference
# to the default, however, if you do not explicitly redefine a datatype, then the
# default will still be used in addition to the datatypes you do specify.
#
# As of 1.5.2, the multi-lingual MARC 21 title ordering is configured as default.
# To use the previous title ordering, comment out the configuration below

## Set the options for how authors are displayed in the browse listing

# Define which field is the author/editor etc listing.  This should be listed in the
# field webui.itemlist.columns, otherwise it will have no effect.
# This cannot be a field already marked out as a title or a date, as this
# will also have no effect.  This is used in conjunction with the
# webui.browse.author-limit field below, to truncate author lists.  For
# configuring links to author publication lists use webui.browse.link below.
# (This setting is not used by the XMLUI as it is controlled by your theme)
#
# webui.browse.author-field = dc.contributor.*

# define how many authors to display before truncating and completing with "et al"
# (or language pack specific alternative)
#
# Use -1 for unlimited (which is what will be used if this option
# is omitted)
#
# webui.browse.author-limit = 3

# which fields should link to other browse listings.  This should associated
# the name of one of the above browse indices with a metadata field listed
# in <webui.itemlist.columns> above.  The form is:
#
# webui.browse.link.<n> = <index name>:<display column metadata>
#
# Note that cross linking will only work for fields other than title.
#
# The effect this has is to create links to browse views for the item clicked on.
# If it is a "single" type, it will link to a view of all the items which share
# that metadata element in common (i.e. all the papers by a single author).  If
# it is a "full" type, it will link to a view of the standard full browse page,
# starting with the value of the link clicked on.
# (This setting is not used by the XMLUI, as links are controlled by your theme)
#
# The default below defines the authors to link to other publications by that author
#

#
# Although not a requirement, it would make sense to include among the listed
# fields at least the date and title fields as specified by the
# webui.browse.index.* configuration options below.
#
# If you have enabled thumbnails (webui.browse.thumbnail.show), you must also
# include a 'thumbnail' entry in your columns - this is where the thumbnail will be displayed

# webui.itemlist.widths = *, 130, 60%, 40%

# Additionally, you can override the DC fields used on the listing page for
# a given browse index and/or sort option. As a sort option or index may be defined
# on a field that isn't normally included in the list, this allows you to display
# the fields that have been indexed / sorted on.
#
# There are a number of forms the configuration can take, and the order in which
# they are listed below is the priority in which they will be used (so a combination
# of an index name and sort name will take precedence over just the browse name).
#
# webui.itemlist.browse.<index name>.sort.<sort name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.sort.<sort name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.browse.<browse name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.<sort or index name>.columns
#
# In the last case, a sort option name will always take precedence over a browse
# index name. Note also, that for any additional columns you list, you will need to
# ensure there is an itemlist.<field name> entry in the messages file.
#
# The following example would display the date of accession in place of the issue date
# whenever the dateaccessioned browse index or sort option is selected.
#
# Just like webui.itemlist.columns, you will need to include a 'thumbnail' entry to display
# and thumbnails in the item list
#
# webui.itemlist.dateaccessioned.columns = thumbnail, dc.date.accessioned(date), dc.title, dc.contributor.*
#
# As above, you can customise the width of the columns for each configured column list, substituting '.widths' for
# '.columns' in the property name. See the setting for webui.itemlist.widths for more details
# webui.itemlist.dateaccessioned.widths = *, 130, 60%, 40%
