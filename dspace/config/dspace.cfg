# DSpace Configuration
#
# NOTE: The DSpace Configuration File is separated into several sections:
#  * General Configurations
#  * UI Configurations

#------------------------------------------------------------------#
#------------------GENERAL CONFIGURATIONS--------------------------#
#------------------------------------------------------------------#
# These configs are used by underlying DSpace API, and are         #
# therefore applicable to all interfaces                           #
# Local configuration should be made in local.cfg (where possible) #
# Global or more complex configuration can be hardcoded here       #
#------------------------------------------------------------------#
##### Basic information ######

# DSpace installation directory
# Windows note: Please remember to use forward slashes for all paths (e.g. C:/dspace)
dspace.dir = /dspace

# URL of DSpace backend ('server' webapp). Include port number etc.
# DO NOT end it with '/'.
# This is where REST API and all enabled server modules (OAI-PMH, SWORD,
# SWORDv2, RDF, etc) will respond.
dspace.server.url = http://localhost:8080/server

# URL of DSpace frontend (Angular UI). Include port number etc.
# DO NOT end it with '/'.
# This is used by the backend to provide links in emails, RSS feeds, Sitemaps,
# etc.
dspace.ui.url = http://localhost:4000

# Name of the site
dspace.name = DSpace at My University

# assetstore.dir, look at DSPACE/config/spring/api/bitstore.xml for more options
assetstore.dir = ${dspace.dir}/assetstore

# Default language for metadata values
default.language = en_US

# Solr server/webapp.
# DSpace uses Solr for all search/browse capability (and for usage statistics).
# Since DSpace 7, SOLR must be installed as a stand-alone service
solr.server = http://localhost:8983/solr

##### Database settings #####
# DSpace only supports two database types: PostgreSQL or Oracle

# URL for connecting to database
#    * Postgres template: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dspace
#    * Oracle template: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/xe
db.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dspace

# JDBC Driver
#    * For Postgres: org.postgresql.Driver
#    * For Oracle:   oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
db.driver = org.postgresql.Driver

# Database Dialect (for Hibernate)
#    * For Postgres: org.dspace.storage.rdbms.hibernate.postgres.DSpacePostgreSQL82Dialect
#    * For Oracle:   org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect
db.dialect = org.dspace.storage.rdbms.hibernate.postgres.DSpacePostgreSQL82Dialect

# Database username and password
db.username = dspace
db.password = dspace

# Database Schema name
#    * For Postgres, this is often "public" (default schema)
#    * For Oracle, schema is equivalent to the username of your database account,
#      so this may be set to ${db.username} in most scenarios.
db.schema = public

## Database Connection pool parameters
# DSpace wraps around the Apache Commons DBCP2 component, to read about its configuration
# see: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/configuration.html
# look at DSPACE/config/spring/api/core-hibernate.xml for more options

# Maximum number of active DB connections in pool (-1 = unlimited)
# (default = 30)
db.maxconnections = 30

# Maximum time to wait before giving up if all connections in pool are busy (milliseconds), (-1 = unlimited)
# (default = 10000ms or 10 seconds)
db.maxwait = 10000

# Minimum number of idle connections in pool
# (default = 0)
db.minidle = 0

# Maximum number of idle connections in pool (-1 = unlimited)
# (default = 10)
db.maxidle = 10

# The initial number of connections created when the pool is started
# (default = 0)
db.initialsize = 0

# The maximum lifetime in milliseconds of a connection.  (-1 = unlimited)
# (default = -1)
db.maxconnlifetime = -1

# Remove abandoned connections. This is documented under "removeAbandonedOnBorrow" in DBCP2.
# (default = false)
db.removeabandoned = false

# Remove abandoned timeout. Timeout in seconds before an abandoned connection can be removed.
# (default = 300 or 5 minutes)
db.removeabandonedtimeout = 300

# Whether or not to allow for an entire 'clean' of the DSpace database.
# By default, this setting is 'true', which ensures that the 'dspace database clean' command
# does nothing (except return an error message saying clean is disabled)
# Setting this config to 'false' allows your database owner to destroy all DSpace data, tables, etc
# by running 'dspace database clean' from commandline. This is only useful for development/testing.
# WARNING: NEVER SET TO 'false' IN PRODUCTION.
# db.cleanDisabled = true

##### Email settings ######

# SMTP mail server (allows DSpace to send email notifications)
mail.server = smtp.example.com

# SMTP mail server authentication username and password (if required)
#mail.server.username =
#mail.server.password =

# SMTP mail server alternate port (defaults to 25)
mail.server.port = 25

# From address for mail
# All mail from the DSpace site will use this 'from' address
mail.from.address = dspace-noreply@myu.edu

# Name of a pre-configured Session object to be fetched from a directory.
# This overrides the Session settings above.  If none can be found, then DSpace
# will use the above settings to create a Session.
#mail.session.name = Session

# When feedback is submitted via the Feedback form, it is sent to this address
# Currently limited to one recipient!
# TODO: UNSUPPORTED in DSpace 7.0
feedback.recipient = dspace-help@myu.edu

# General site administration (Webmaster) e-mail
# System notifications/reports and other sysadmin emails are sent to this address
mail.admin = dspace-help@myu.edu
mail.admin.name = DSpace Administrator

# Recipient for server errors and alerts (defaults to mail.admin)
alert.recipient = ${mail.admin}

# Recipient for new user registration emails (defaults to unspecified)
#registration.notify =

# Set the default mail character set. This may be overridden by providing a line
# inside the email template "charset: <encoding>", otherwise this default is used.
mail.charset = UTF-8

# A comma-separated list of hostnames that are allowed to refer browsers to email forms.
# Default behaviour is to accept referrals only from dspace.hostname
# TODO: UNSUPPORTED in DSpace 7.0
#mail.allowed.referrers = ${dspace.hostname}

# Pass extra settings to the Java mail library. Comma-separated, equals sign between
# the key and the value. For example:
#mail.extraproperties = mail.smtp.socketFactory.port=465, \
#                       mail.smtp.socketFactory.class=javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory, \
#                       mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback=false

# An option is added to disable the mailserver. By default, this property is set to false
# By setting mail.server.disabled = true, DSpace will not send out emails.
# It will instead log the subject of the email which should have been sent
# This is especially useful for development and test environments where production data is used when testing functionality.
#mail.server.disabled = false

# Message headers which may be set within a message template by assigning values
# to Velocity properties.  Only the properties named here will be interpreted as
# header values.  In most cases the name of the property will become the
# header's name, and the value of the property, the header's value.
# For example:  '#set(My-Header, "Hello World!")' in a template will result in
# the message having a header "My-Header: Hello World!" IFF mail.message.headers
# includes "My-Header".
#
# A few names are special:
# 'subject' supplies the Subject: header's value.
# 'charset' sets the 'charset' parameter of the Content-Type: header of the
#           bodypart, when there is a single bodypart.  It also causes the
#           subject value to be treated as being encoded in this charset.
#           If not set, the charset defaults to US-ASCII as specified in RFC 2046.
#           If there are multiple bodyparts, all are assumed to be encoded in
#           US-ASCII and 'charset' has no effect on them.
mail.message.headers = subject
mail.message.headers = charset

##### Asset Storage (bitstreams / files) ######
# Moved to config/spring/api/bitstore.xml

##### Logging configuration #####
# Main logging settings can be found in config/log4j2.xml
# below some configuration properties for the server webapp that can be modified at runtime
logging.server.include-after-request = false
logging.server.include-payload = false
logging.server.include-headers = false
logging.server.include-query-string = false
logging.server.include-client-info = false
logging.server.max-payload-length = 10000

##### DOI registration agency credentials ######
# To mint DOIs you have to use a DOI registration agency like DataCite. Several
# DataCite members offers services as DOI registration agency, so f.e. EZID or
# TIB Hannover. To mint DOIs with DSpace you have to get an agreement with an
# DOI registration agency. You have to edit
# [dspace]/config/spring/api/identifier-service.xml and to configure the following
# properties.

# Credentials used to authenticate against the registration agency:
identifier.doi.user = username
identifier.doi.password = password
# DOI prefix used to mint DOIs. All DOIs minted by DSpace will use this prefix.
# The Prefix will be assigned by the registration agency.
identifier.doi.prefix = 10.5072
# If you want to, you can further separate your namespace. Should all the
# suffixes of all DOIs minted by DSpace start with a special string to separate
# it from other services also minting DOIs under your prefix?
identifier.doi.namespaceseparator = dspace/

##### Plugin management #####

# Where to look for third-party plugin packages.  The value is a colon-separated
# list of filesystem directories and/or JAR files:  a Java class path.  Plugin
# classes not found in the usual places will be sought in these places last.  If
# unset, only the standard places will be searched.
#plugin.classpath = ${dspace.dir}/plugins/aPlugin.jar

##### Search settings #####

# DSpace search/browse is now driven by Discovery (Solr backend).
# Therefore, search settings are configurable either via Discovery's configurations
# or via Solr's configuration. Some Browse settings are still customizable within
# this configuration file (see "Browse Configuration" section below).
#
# Discovery configurations may be used to modify which fields in DSpace are
# browseable/searchable or appear as filters/facets. These are configured in
# the discovery.xml at:
#   [dspace]/config/spring/api/discovery.xml
#
# See also the Discovery Documentation:
#   https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Discovery

##### Handle settings ######

# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# Items in DSpace receive a unique URL, stored in dc.identifier.uri
# after it is generated during the submission process.
handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.ui.url}/handle/

# If you register with CNRI's handle service at http://www.handle.net/,
# these links can be generated as permalinks using http://hdl.handle.net/
# as canonical prefix. Please make sure to change handle.canonical.prefix
# after registering with handle.net by uncommenting one of the following
# lines, depending if you prefer to use http or https:
# handle.canonical.prefix = http://hdl.handle.net/
# handle.canonical.prefix = https://hdl.handle.net/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifier.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions).

# CNRI Handle prefix
# (Defaults to a dummy/fake prefix of 123456789)
handle.prefix = 123456789

# Directory for installing Handle server files
handle.dir = ${dspace.dir}/handle-server

# List any additional prefixes that need to be managed by this handle server
# (as for examle handle prefix coming from old dspace repository merged in
# that repository)
# handle.additional.prefixes = prefix1[, prefix2]

# By default we hide the list handles method in the JSON endpoint as it could
# produce heavy load for large repository
# handle.hide.listhandles = false

##### Authorization system configuration - Delegate ADMIN #####

#### Restricted item visibilty settings ###
# By default RSS feeds, OAI-PMH and subscription emails will include ALL items
# regardless of permissions set on them.
#
# If you wish to only expose items through these channels where the ANONYMOUS
# user is granted READ permission, then set the following options to false
#
# Warning: In large repositories, setting harvest.includerestricted.oai to false may cause
# performance problems as all items will need to have their authorization permissions checked,
# but because DSpace has not implemented resumption tokens in ListIdentifiers, ALL items will
# need checking whenever a ListIdentifers request is made.
#
#harvest.includerestricted.rss = true
#harvest.includerestricted.oai = true
#harvest.includerestricted.subscription = true


#### Proxy Settings ######
# uncomment and specify both properties if proxy server required
# proxy server for external http requests - use regular hostname without port number
http.proxy.host =

# port number of proxy server
http.proxy.port =

# If enabled, the logging and the Solr statistics system will look for an X-Forwarded-For header.
# If it finds it, it will use this for the user IP address.
# NOTE: This is required to be enabled if you plan to use the Angular UI, as the server-side rendering provided in
# Angular always passes the original client IP Address to the REST API via the X-Forwarded-For header.
useProxies = true

# If "useProxies" is enabled, the authentication and statistics logging code will read the X-Forwarded-For header in
# order to determine the correct client IP address. But they will only use that header value when the request is coming
# from a trusted proxy server location.
# By default, ONLY requests from localhost (127.0.0.1) will be trusted. However, you can use this setting to specify
# additional IP addresses (or ranges) whose X-Forwarded-For header values will also be trusted.
# You can specify a range by only listing the first three ip-address blocks, e.g. 128.177.243
# You can list multiple IP addresses or ranges by comma-separating them.
# (Requires reboot of servlet container, e.g. Tomcat, to reload)
#proxies.trusted.ipranges = 127.0.0.1

# Whether or not to automatically include the IP address of ${dspace.ui.url} in the list of trusted ip ranges.
# This defaults to "true", as some features in the Angular UI (like authentication) require sending an X-Forwarded-For
# header. Therefore, only disable this if you are not using the Angular UI, or you wish to specify its IP manually
# in the "proxies.trusted.ipranges" configuration.
# (Requires reboot of servlet container, e.g. Tomcat, to reload)
#proxies.trusted.include_ui_ip = true

# Use this to configure the browse indices. Each entry will receive a link in the
# navigation. Each entry can be configured in one of two ways. The first is:
#
# webui.browse.index.<n> = <index name> : metadata : \
#                                                       <schema prefix>.<element>[.<qualifier>|.*] : \

#
# This form represent a unique index of metadata values from the item.
#
# (date | title | text | <other>) refers to the datatype of the field.
#                       date: the index type will be treated as a date object
#                       title: the index type will be treated like a title, which will include
#                                       a link to the item page
#                       text: the index type will be treated as plain text.  If single mode is
#                                       specified then this will link to the full mode list
#           <other>: any other datatype will be treated the same as 'text', although
#                   it will apply any custom ordering normalisation configured below
#
#   The two last parts of the configuration are optional, and specifies the default ordering
#   for the index - whether it is ASCending (the default, and best for text indexes), or
#   DESCending (useful for dates - ie. most recent submissions) - and the sort option to use.
#   If you want to define the sort option you must define order as well.
#
#   NOTE: the text to render the index will use the <index name> parameter to select
#   the message key from Messages.properties using a key of the form:
#
# browse.type.metadata.<index name>
#
# The other form is for indexes of the items themselves, ie. each entry will be displayed
# according to the configuration of by webui.itemlist.columns:
#
# webui.browse.index.<n> = <index name> : item : <sort option name> : (asc | desc)
#
# sort option name: this is the sorting to be applied to the display. It must match the
#                   name given to one of the webui.itemlist.sort-option entries given below.
#
#   The final part of the configuration is optional, and specifies the default ordering
#   for the index - whether it is ASCending (the default, and best for text indexes), or
#   DESCending (useful for dates - ie. most recent submissions)

#   NOTE: the text to render the index will use the <sort option name> parameter to select
#   the message key from the UI language packs key of the form:
#
# browse.metadata.<sort option name>
#
# Note: the index numbers <n> must start from 1 and increment continuously by 1
# thereafter.  Deviation from this will cause an error during install or
# configuration update
#
# Note #2: When specifying multiple metadata fields in one index, please
# separate them with an ESCAPED comma (\,). Commas which are unescaped will
# result in "Browse Index configuration is not valid" errors.

#
# This is defined much the same as above.  The parameter after the metadata
# just lets the sorter know which normalisation to use - standard normalisations are title,
# text or date - however additional normalisations can be defined using the PluginService.
#
# The final parts of the configuration is optional -  whether to SHOW (the default) or

## The DSpaceControlledVocabulary plugin is automatically configured
## with every *.xml file in [dspace]/config/controlled-vocabularies,
## and creates a plugin instance for each, using base filename as the name.
## eg: nsi, srsc.
## Each DSpaceControlledVocabulary plugin comes with three configuration options:
# vocabulary.plugin._plugin_.hierarchy.store = <true|false>    # default: true
# vocabulary.plugin._plugin_.hierarchy.suggest = <true|false>  # default: false
# vocabulary.plugin._plugin_.delimiter = "<string>"            # default: "::"

# Customise the DC fields to use in the item listing page.  Elements will be
# displayed left to right in the order that they are specified here.
#
# The form is <schema prefix>.<element>[.<qualifier>|.*][(date)], ...
#
# Although not a requirement, it would make sense to include among the listed
# fields at least the date and title fields as specified by the
# webui.browse.index.* configuration options below.
#
# If you have enabled thumbnails (webui.browse.thumbnail.show), you must also
# include a 'thumbnail' entry in your columns - this is where the thumbnail will be displayed
#
# If you want to mark each item include a 'mark_[value]' (without the brackets - replace the word 'value' with anything that
# has a meaning for your mark) entry in your columns - this is where the icon will be displayed.
# Do not forget to add a Spring bean with id = "org.dspace.app.itemmarking.ItemMarkingExtractor.[value]"
# in file 'config/spring/api/item-marking.xml'. This bean is responsible for drawing the appropriate mark for each item.
# You can add more than one 'mark_[value]' options (with different value) in case you need to mark items more than one time for
# different purposes. Remember to add the respective beans in file 'config/spring/api/item-marking.xml'.
#
# webui.itemlist.columns = thumbnail, dc.date.issued(date), dc.title, dc.contributor.*
#
# You can customise the width of each column with the following line - you can have numbers (pixels)
# or percentages. For the 'thumbnail' column, a setting of '*' will use the max width specified
# for browse thumbnails (webui.browse.thumbnail.maxwidth, thumbnail.maxwidth)
# webui.itemlist.widths = *, 130, 60%, 40%

# Additionally, you can override the DC fields used on the listing page for
# a given browse index and/or sort option. As a sort option or index may be defined
# on a field that isn't normally included in the list, this allows you to display
# the fields that have been indexed / sorted on.
#
# There are a number of forms the configuration can take, and the order in which
# they are listed below is the priority in which they will be used (so a combination
# of an index name and sort name will take precedence over just the browse name).
#
# webui.itemlist.browse.<index name>.sort.<sort name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.sort.<sort name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.browse.<browse name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.<sort or index name>.columns
#
# In the last case, a sort option name will always take precedence over a browse
# index name. Note also, that for any additional columns you list, you will need to
# ensure there is an itemlist.<field name> entry in the messages file.
#
# The following example would display the date of accession in place of the issue date
# whenever the dateaccessioned browse index or sort option is selected.
#
# Just like webui.itemlist.columns, you will need to include a 'thumbnail' entry to display
# and thumbnails in the item list
#
# webui.itemlist.dateaccessioned.columns = thumbnail, dc.date.accessioned(date), dc.title, dc.contributor.*
#
# As above, you can customise the width of the columns for each configured column list, substituting '.widths' for
# '.columns' in the property name. See the setting for webui.itemlist.widths for more details
# webui.itemlist.dateaccessioned.widths = *, 130, 60%, 40%

# You can also set the overall size of the item list table with the following setting. It can lead to faster
# table rendering when used with the column widths above, but not generally recommended.
# webui.itemlist.tablewidth = 100%

##### SFX Server (OpenURL) #####

# SFX query is appended to this URL.  If this property is commented out or
# omitted, SFX support is switched off.
# sfx.server.url = http://sfx.myu.edu:8888/sfx?

# This image will be displayed in the SFX link. If commented out, the SFX link will be only a text link.
# This customization usually contains an institution-branded SFX button.
# sfx.server.image_url = http://sfx.my.edu:8888/sfx.gif

##### Google Analytics #####

# If you would like to use Google Analytics to track general website statistics then
# use the following parameter to provide your Analytics key. First sign up for an
# account at http://analytics.google.com, then create an entry for your repository
# website. Analytics will give you a snipet of JavaScript code to place on your site,
# inside that snipet is your Google Analytics key usually found in this line:
# _uacct = "UA-XXXXXXX-X"
# Take this key (just the UA-XXXXXX-X part) and place it here in this parameter.
# google.analytics.key=UA-XXXXXX-X
# The max number of events held in the GA buffer (default: 256)
# google.analytics.buffer.limit=256
