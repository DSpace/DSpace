#------------------------------------------------------------------#
#------------------GENERAL CONFIGURATIONS--------------------------#
#------------------------------------------------------------------#
# These configs are used by underlying DSpace API, and are         #
# therefore applicable to all interfaces                           #
# Local, simple configuration should be made in build.properties   #
# Global or more complex configuration can be hardcoded here       #
#------------------------------------------------------------------#
##### Basic information ######

# DSpace installation directory
dspace.dir = ${dspace.install.dir}

# DSpace host name - should match base URL.  Do not include port number.
dspace.hostname = ${dspace.hostname}

# DSpace base host URL.  Include port number etc.
dspace.baseUrl = ${dspace.baseUrl}

# DSpace base URL.  Include port number etc., but NOT trailing slash
# Change to xmlui if you wish to use the xmlui as the default, or remove
# "/jspui" and set webapp of your choice as the "ROOT" webapp in
# the servlet engine.
dspace.url = ${dspace.baseUrl}/xmlui

# Optional: DSpace URL for mobile access
# This 
#dspace.mobileUrl = http://mobile.example.com

# Name of the site
dspace.name = ${dspace.name}

# Default language for metadata values
default.language = ${default.language}

##### Database settings #####

# Database name ("oracle", or "postgres")
db.name = ${db.name}

# URL for connecting to database
db.url = ${db.url}

# JDBC Driver
db.driver = ${db.driver}

# Database username and password
db.username = ${db.username}
db.password = ${db.password}

# Schema name - if your database contains multiple schemas, you can avoid problems with
# retrieving the definitions of duplicate object names by specifying
# the schema name here that is used for DSpace by uncommenting the following entry
db.schema = ${db.schema}

# Connection pool parameters

# Maximum number of DB connections in pool
db.maxconnections = ${db.maxconnections}

# Maximum time to wait before giving up if all connections in pool are busy (milliseconds)
db.maxwait = ${db.maxwait}

# Maximum number of idle connections in pool (-1 = unlimited)
db.maxidle = ${db.maxidle}

# Determine if prepared statement should be cached. (default is true)
db.statementpool = ${db.statementpool}

# Specify a name for the connection pool (useful if you have multiple applications sharing Tomcat's dbcp)
# If not specified, defaults to 'dspacepool'
db.poolname = ${db.poolname}

# Specify a configured database connection pool to be fetched from a
# directory.  This overrides the pool and driver settings above.  If
# none can be found, then DSpace will use the above settings to create a
# pool.  db.name should be specified regardless.
#db.jndi = jdbc/dspace

##### Email settings ######

# SMTP mail server
mail.server = ${mail.server}

# SMTP mail server authentication username and password (if required)
mail.server.username = ${mail.server.username}
mail.server.password = ${mail.server.password}

# SMTP mail server alternate port (defaults to 25)
mail.server.port = ${mail.server.port}

# From address for mail
mail.from.address = ${mail.from.address}

# Name of a pre-configured Session object to be fetched from a directory.
# This overrides the Session settings above.  If none can be found, then DSpace
# will use the above settings to create a Session.
#mail.session.name = Session

# Currently limited to one recipient!
feedback.recipient = ${mail.feedback.recipient}

# General site administration (Webmaster) e-mail
mail.admin = ${mail.admin}

# Recipient for server errors and alerts
alert.recipient = ${mail.alert.recipient}

# Recipient for new user registration emails
registration.notify = ${mail.registration.notify}

# Set the default mail character set. This may be overridden by providing a line
# inside the email template "charset: <encoding>", otherwise this default is used.
mail.charset = UTF-8

# A comma-separated list of hostnames that are allowed to refer browsers to email forms.
# Default behaviour is to accept referrals only from dspace.hostname
mail.allowed.referrers = ${dspace.hostname}

# Pass extra settings to the Java mail library. Comma-separated, equals sign between
# the key and the value. For example:
#mail.extraproperties = mail.smtp.socketFactory.port=465, \
#                       mail.smtp.socketFactory.class=javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory, \
#                       mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback=false

# An option is added to disable the mailserver. By default, this property is set to false
# By setting mail.server.disabled = true, DSpace will not send out emails.
# It will instead log the subject of the email which should have been sent
# This is especially useful for development and test environments where production data is used when testing functionality.
#mail.server.disabled = false

##### File Storage ######

# Asset (bitstream) store number 0 (zero)
assetstore.dir = ${dspace.dir}/assetstore


# Specify extra asset stores like this, counting from 1 upwards:
# assetstore.dir.1 = /second/assetstore
# assetstore.dir.2 = /third/assetstore

# Specify the number of the store to use for new bitstreams with this property
# The default is 0 (zero) which corresponds to the 'assetstore.dir' above
# assetstore.incoming = 1


##### SRB File Storage #####

# The same 'assetstore.incoming' property is used to support the use of SRB
# (Storage Resource Broker - see http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/) as an _optional_
# replacement of or supplement to conventional file storage. DSpace will work
# with or without SRB and full backward compatibility is maintained.
#
# The 'assetstore.incoming' property is an integer that references where _new_
# bitstreams will be stored.  The default (say the starting reference) is zero.
# The value will be used to identify the storage where all new bitstreams will
# be stored until this number is changed.  This number is stored in the
# Bitstream table (store_number column) in the DSpace database, so older
# bitstreams that may have been stored when 'asset.incoming' had a different
# value can be found.
#
# In the simple case in which DSpace uses local (or mounted) storage the
# number can refer to different directories (or partitions).  This gives DSpace
# some level of scalability.  The number links to another set of properties
# 'assetstore.dir', 'assetstore.dir.1' (remember zero is default),
# 'assetstore.dir.2', etc., where the values are directories.
#
# To support the use of SRB DSpace uses this same scheme but broadened to
# support:
# - using SRB instead of the local filesystem
# - using the local filesystem (native DSpace)
# - using a mix of SRB and local filesystem
#
# In this broadened use the 'asset.incoming' integer will refer one of the
# following storage locations
# - a local filesystem directory (native DSpace)
# - a set of SRB account parameters (host, port, zone, domain, username,
#       password, home directory, and resource)
#
# Should there be any conflict, like '2' refering to a local directory and
# to a set of SRB parameters, the program will select the local directory.
#
# If SRB is chosen from the first install of DSpace, it is suggested that
# 'assetstore.dir' (no integer appended) be retained to reference a local
# directory (as above under File Storage) because build.xml uses this value
# to do a mkdir. In this case, 'assetstore.incoming' can be set to 1 (i.e.
# uncomment the line in File Storage above) and the 'assetstore.dir' will not
# be used.
#
# Here is an example set of SRB parameters:
# Assetstore 1 - SRB
#srb.host.1 = mysrbmcathost.myu.edu
#srb.port.1 = 5544
#srb.mcatzone.1 = mysrbzone
#srb.mdasdomainname.1 = mysrbdomain
#srb.defaultstorageresource.1 = mydefaultsrbresource
#srb.username.1 = mysrbuser
#srb.password.1 = mysrbpassword
#srb.homedirectory.1 = /mysrbzone/home/mysrbuser.mysrbdomain
#srb.parentdir.1 = mysrbdspaceassetstore
#
# Assetstore n, n+1, ...
# Follow same pattern as for assetstores above (local or SRB)


##### Logging configuration #####

# Override default log4j configuration
# You may provide your own configuration here, existing alternatives are:
# log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j.xml
# log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j-console.properties
log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j.properties

# Where to put the logs (used in configuration only)
log.dir = ${dspace.dir}/log

# If enabled, the logging and the Solr statistics system will look for
# an X-Forwarded-For header. If it finds it, it will use this for the user IP address
#useProxies = true

##### DOI registration agency credentials ######
# To mint DOIs you have to use a DOI registration agency like DataCite. Several
# DataCite members offers services as DOI registration agency, so f.e. EZID or
# TIB Hannover. To mint DOIs with DSpace you have to get an agreement with an
# DOI registration agency. You have to edit 
# [dspace]/config/spring/api/identifier-service.xml and to configure the following
# properties.

# Credentials used to authenticate against the registration agency:
identifier.doi.user = username
identifier.doi.password = password
# DOI prefix used to mint DOIs. All DOIs minted by DSpace will use this prefix.
# The Prefix will be assinged by the registration agency.
identifier.doi.prefix = 10.5072
# If you want to, you can further separate your namespace. Should all the suffix
# of all DOIs minted by DSpace start with a special string to separate it from
# other services also minting DOIs under your prefix?
identifier.doi.namespaceseparator = dspace/

##### Search settings #####

# Where to put search index files
search.dir = ${dspace.dir}/search

# Higher values of search.max-clauses will enable prefix searches to work on
# large repositories
search.max-clauses = 2048

# Which Lucene Analyzer implementation to use.  If this is omitted or
# commented out, the standard DSpace analyzer (designed for English)
# is used by default.

# Non-Stemming analyzer.  Does not "stem" words/terms. When using this analyzer,
# a search for "wellness" will always return items matching "wellness" and not "well".
# However, similarly a search for "experiments" will only return objects matching 
# "experiments" and not "experiment" or "experimenting".
# search.analyzer = org.dspace.search.DSNonStemmingAnalyzer

# Chinese analyzer
# search.analyzer = org.apache.lucene.analysis.cn.ChineseAnalyzer

search.analyzer = org.dspace.search.DSAnalyzer

# Boolean search operator to use, current supported values are OR and AND
# If this config item is missing or commented out, OR is used
# AND requires all search terms to be present
# OR requires one or more search terms to be present
search.operator = OR

# Maximum number of terms indexed for a single field in Lucene.
# Default is 10,000 words - often not enough for full-text indexing.
# If you change this, you'll need to re-index for the change
# to take effect on previously added items.
# -1 = unlimited (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
search.maxfieldlength = 10000

##### Fields to Index for Search #####

# DC metadata elements.qualifiers to be indexed for search
# format: - search.index.[number] = [search field]:element.qualifier
#       - * used as wildcard
#	- inputform -> In case we have different input-forms for different repository supported locales (e.g input-forms_el.xml, input-forms_pt.xml etc). In this case, the 
#		stored and the displayed value from all input-forms are indexed. If the stored value is not found in input-forms, it is indexed anyway.
#		e.g.:search.index.12 = language:dc.language:inputform
#
###      changing these will change your search results,     ###
###  but will NOT automatically change your search displays  ###

search.index.1 = author:dc.contributor.*
search.index.2 = author:dc.creator.*
search.index.3 = title:dc.title.*
search.index.4 = keyword:dc.subject.*
search.index.5 = abstract:dc.description.abstract
search.index.6 = author:dc.description.statementofresponsibility
search.index.7 = series:dc.relation.ispartofseries
search.index.8 = abstract:dc.description.tableofcontents
search.index.9 = mime:dc.format.mimetype
search.index.10 = sponsor:dc.description.sponsorship
search.index.11 = identifier:dc.identifier.*
search.index.12 = language:dc.language.iso

##### Handle settings ######

# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# By default, DSpace is configured to use http://hdl.handle.net/
# as the canonical URL prefix when generating dc.identifier.uri
# during submission, and in the 'identifier' displayed in JSPUI
# item record pages.
#
# If you do not subscribe to CNRI's handle service, you can change this
# to match the persistent URL service you use, or you can force DSpace
# to use your site's URL, eg.
#handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.url}/handle/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifer.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions), but it will alter the URL
# in JSPUI's 'identifier' message on item record pages for existing items.
#
# If omitted, the canonical URL prefix will be http://hdl.handle.net/
handle.canonical.prefix = ${handle.canonical.prefix}

# CNRI Handle prefix
handle.prefix = ${handle.prefix}

# Directory for installing Handle server files
handle.dir = ${dspace.dir}/handle-server

# List any additional prefixes that need to be managed by this handle server 
# (as for examle handle prefix coming from old dspace repository merged in 
# that repository)
# handle.additional.prefixes = prefix1[, prefix2]  

# By default we hide the list handles method in the JSON endpoint as it could 
# produce heavy load for large repository 
# handle.hide.listhandles = false

#### Restricted item visibilty settings ###
# By default RSS feeds, OAI-PMH and subscription emails will include ALL items
# regardless of permissions set on them.
#
# If you wish to only expose items through these channels where the ANONYMOUS
# user is granted READ permission, then set the following options to false
#
# Warning: In large repositories, setting harvest.includerestricted.oai to false may cause
# performance problems as all items will need to have their authorization permissions checked,
# but because DSpace has not implemented resumption tokens in ListIdentifiers, ALL items will
# need checking whenever a ListIdentifers request is made.
#
#harvest.includerestricted.rss = true

###### ItemCounter Configuration ######

# By default, since DSpace 4.0, the Solr implementation is used.
#
# Only if you use a DBMS implementation and want to use the cache

# to update the count:
#
# [dspace]/bin/itemcounter	(NOT required if you use the Solr implementation)
#
#
# PostgreSQL:
# ItemCountDAO.class = org.dspace.browse.ItemCountDAOPostgres
#

#
# Use this to configure the browse indices. Each entry will receive a link in the
# navigation. Each entry can be configured in one of two ways. The first is:
#
# webui.browse.index.<n> = <index name> : metadata : \

#
# This form represent a unique index of metadata values from the item.
#
# (date | title | text | <other>) refers to the datatype of the field.
#                       date: the index type will be treated as a date object
#                       title: the index type will be treated like a title, which will include
#                                       a link to the item page
#                       text: the index type will be treated as plain text.  If single mode is
#                                       specified then this will link to the full mode list
#           <other>: any other datatype will be treated the same as 'text', although
#                   it will apply any custom ordering normalisation configured below
#
#   The final part of the configuration is optional, and specifies the default ordering
#   for the index - whether it is ASCending (the default, and best for text indexes), or
#   DESCending (useful for dates - ie. most recent submissions)
#
#   NOTE: the text to render the index will use the <index name> parameter to select
#   the message key from Messages.properties using a key of the form:
#
# browse.type.metadata.<index name>
#
# The other form is for indexes of the items themselves, ie. each entry will be displayed
# according to the configuration of by webui.itemlist.columns:
#
# webui.browse.index.<n> = <index name> : item : <sort option name> : (asc | desc)
#
# sort option name: this is the sorting to be applied to the display. It must match the
#                   name given to one of the webui.itemlist.sort-option entries given below.
#
#   The final part of the configuration is optional, and specifies the default ordering
#   for the index - whether it is ASCending (the default, and best for text indexes), or
#   DESCending (useful for dates - ie. most recent submissions)

#   NOTE: the text to render the index will use the <sort option name> parameter to select
#   the message key from Messages.properties (for JSPUI) using a key of the form:
#
# browse.type.item.<sort option name>
#
# Note: the index numbers <n> must start from 1 and increment continuously by 1
# thereafter.  Deviation from this will cause an error during install or
# configuration update
#
# For compatibility with previous versions:

# Set the options for what can be sorted by
#
# Sort options will be available when browsing a list of items (i.e. an 'item' browse,
# or search results).  You can define an arbitrary number of fields
# to sort on, irrespective of which fields you display using webui.itemlist.columns
#
# the format is:
#
# webui.itemlist.sort-option.<n> = <option name> : \
#                                                                       <schema prefix>.<element>[.<qualifier>|.*] : \

#
# This is defined much the same as above.  The parameter after the metadata
# just lets the sorter know which normalisation to use - standard normalisations are title,
# text or date - however additional normalisations can be defined using the PluginManager.
#
# The final parts of the configuration is optional -  whether to SHOW (the default) or
# HIDE the option from the sorting controls in the user interface. This can be useful if
# you need to define a specific date sort for use by the recent items lists,
# but otherwise don't want users to choose that option.

#   Olive oil
#   olive oil
#
# However, clicking through from either of these will result in the same set of items
# (ie. any item that contains either representation in the correct field).
#
# Uncommenting the option below will make the metadata items case-insensitive. This will
# result in a single entry in the example above. However the value displayed may be either 'Olive oil'
# or 'olive oil' - depending on what representation was present in the first item indexed.
#
# If you care about the display of the metadata in the browse index - well, you'll have to go and
# fix the metadata in your items.

# webui.browse.metadata.case-insensitive = true

# Set the options for the size (number of characters) of the fields stored in the database.
#
# The default is 0, which is unlimited size for fields holding indexed data.  Some
# database implementations (e.g. Oracle) will enforce their own limit on this field
# size. Reducing the field size will decrease the potential size of your database and
# increase the speed of the browse, but it will also increase the chance of
# mis-ordering of similar fields.  Below are commented out, but proposed values for
# reasonably performance versus result quality
#
# Size of field for the browse value (this will affect display, and value sorting)
#
# webui.browse.value_columns.max = 500

#
# webui.browse.value_columns.omission_mark = ...

# Set the options for how the indexes are sorted
#
# All sorts of normalisations are carried out by the OrderFormatDelegate.
# The plugin manager can be used to specify your own delegates for each datatype.

# The default datatypes (and delegates) are:
#
# author = org.dspace.sort.OrderFormatAuthor
# title  = org.dspace.sort.OrderFormatTitle
# text   = org.dspace.sort.OrderFormatText
#
# If you redefine a default datatype here, the configuration will be used in preference
# to the default, however, if you do not explicitly redefine a datatype, then the
# default will still be used in addition to the datatypes you do specify.

## Set the options for how authors are displayed in the browse listing

# Define which field is the author/editor etc listing.  This should be listed in the
# field webui.itemlist.columns, otherwise it will have no effect.
# This cannot be a field already marked out as a title or a date, as this
# will also have no effect.  This is used in conjunction with the
# webui.browse.author-limit field below, to truncate author lists.  For
# configuring links to author publication lists use webui.browse.link below.
# (This setting is not used by the XMLUI as it is controlled by your theme)
#

#
# webui.browse.link.<n> = <index name>:<display column metadata>
#
# Note that cross linking will only work for fields other than title.
#
# The effect this has is to create links to browse views for the item clicked on.
# If it is a "single" type, it will link to a view of all the items which share
# that metadata element in common (i.e. all the papers by a single author).  If
# it is a "full" type, it will link to a view of the standard full browse page,
# starting with the value of the link clicked on.

# vocabulary.plugin._plugin_.hierarchy.suggest = <true|false>  # default: true
# vocabulary.plugin._plugin_.delimiter = "<string>"            # default: "::"

# When using "resolver" in webui.itemdisplay to render identifiers as resolvable
# links, the base URL is taken from <code>webui.resolver.<n>.baseurl</code>
# where <code>webui.resolver.<n>.urn</code> matches the urn specified in the metadata value.
# The value is appended to the "baseurl" as is, so the baseurl need to end with slash almost in any case.
# If no urn is specified in the value it will be displayed as simple text.
#
#webui.resolver.1.urn = doi

# The form is <schema prefix>.<element>[.<qualifier>|.*][(date)], ...
#
# Although not a requirement, it would make sense to include among the listed
# fields at least the date and title fields as specified by the
# webui.browse.index.* configuration options below.
#
# If you have enabled thumbnails (webui.browse.thumbnail.show), you must also
# include a 'thumbnail' entry in your columns - this is where the thumbnail will be displayed
#
# webui.itemlist.columns = thumbnail, dc.date.issued(date), dc.title, dc.contributor.*
#
# You can customise the width of each column with the following line - you can have numbers (pixels)
# or percentages. For the 'thumbnail' column, a setting of '*' will use the max width specified
# for browse thumbnails (webui.browse.thumbnail.maxwidth, thumbnail.maxwidth)
# webui.itemlist.widths = *, 130, 60%, 40%

# Additionally, you can override the DC fields used on the listing page for
# a given browse index and/or sort option. As a sort option or index may be defined
# on a field that isn't normally included in the list, this allows you to display
# the fields that have been indexed / sorted on.
#
# There are a number of forms the configuration can take, and the order in which
# they are listed below is the priority in which they will be used (so a combination
# of an index name and sort name will take precedence over just the browse name).
#
# webui.itemlist.browse.<index name>.sort.<sort name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.sort.<sort name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.browse.<browse name>.columns
# webui.itemlist.<sort or index name>.columns
#
# In the last case, a sort option name will always take precedence over a browse
# index name. Note also, that for any additional columns you list, you will need to
# ensure there is an itemlist.<field name> entry in the messages file.
#
# The following example would display the date of accession in place of the issue date
# whenever the dateaccessioned browse index or sort option is selected.
#
# Just like webui.itemlist.columns, you will need to include a 'thumbnail' entry to display
# and thumbnails in the item list
#
# webui.itemlist.dateaccessioned.columns = thumbnail, dc.date.accessioned(date), dc.title, dc.contributor.*
#
# As above, you can customise the width of the columns for each configured column list, substituting '.widths' for
# '.columns' in the property name. See the setting for webui.itemlist.widths for more details
# webui.itemlist.dateaccessioned.widths = *, 130, 60%, 40%

# You can also set the overall size of the item list table with the following setting. It can lead to faster
# table rendering when used with the column widths above, but not generally recommended.
# webui.itemlist.tablewidth = 100%

# If you would like to use Google Analytics to track general website statistics then

# account at http://analytics.google.com, then create an entry for your repository
# website. Analytics will give you a snipet of JavaScript code to place on your site,
# inside that snipet is your Google Analytics key usually found in this line:
# _uacct = "UA-XXXXXXX-X"
# Take this key (just the UA-XXXXXX-X part) and place it here in this parameter.

# Check if the user has a consistent ip address from the start of the login process
# to the end of the login process. Disabling this check is not recommended unless
# absolutely necessary as the ip check can be helpful for preventing session

### Settings for Item lists in Mirage theme ###
# What should the emphasis be in the display of item lists?
# Possible values : 'file', 'metadata'. If your repository is
# used mainly for scientific papers 'metadata' is probably the
# best way. If you have a lot of images and other files 'file'
# will be the best starting point
# (metdata is the default value if this option is not specified)

# Determine which bundles administrators and collection administrators may upload
# into an existing item through the administrative interface. If the user does not
# have the appropriate privileges (add & write) on the bundle then that bundle will
# not be shown to the user as an option.

# On the community-list page should all the metadata about a community/collection
# be available to the theme. This parameter defaults to true, but if you are

# with turning this option off.
#xmlui.community-list.render.full = false

# Normally, Manakin will fully verify any cache pages before using a cache copy.
# This means that when the community-list page is viewed the database is queried
# for each community/collection to see if their metadata has been modified. This
# can be expensive for repositories with a large community tree. To help solve
# this problem you can set the cache to be assumed valued for a specific set of time.
# The downside of this is that new or editing communities/collections may not show up
# the website for a period of time.
#xmlui.community-list.cache = 12 hours

# Optionally you may configure Manakin to take advantage of metadata stored as a
# bitstream. These metadata files should be inside the "METADATA" bundle and named
# either MODS.xml or METS.xml. If either of the following options are turned on then
# these files will be made available to the theme when rendering an item.
