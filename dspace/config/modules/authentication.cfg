#----------ENABLED AUTHENTICATION METHODS/PLUGINS---------------#
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
# This configuration setting contains the listing of all        #
# currently enabled authentication plugins. DSpace supports an  #
# Authentication "stack" which allows you to enable multiple    #
# forms of Authentication at the same time. Enabled             #
# Authentication plugins are invoked in order until one of them #
# succeeds.                                                     #
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
# Out-of-the-box DSpace Authentication Plugins include:
#  * Authentication by Password
#        Plugin class: org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication
#        Configuration file: authentication-password.cfg
#  * Shibboleth Authentication
#        Plugin class: org.dspace.authenticate.ShibAuthentication
#        Configuration file: authentication-shibboleth.cfg
#  * LDAP Authentication
#        LDAP Plugin class: org.dspace.authenticate.LDAPAuthentication
#        Configuration file: authentication-ldap.cfg
#  * IP Address Authentication
#        Plugin class: org.dspace.authenticate.IPAuthentication
#        Configuration file: authentication-ip.cfg
#  * X.509 Certificate Authentication
#        Plugin class: org.dspace.authenticate.X509Authentication
#        Configuration file: authentication-x509.cfg
#
# One or more of the above plugins can be enabled by listing its plugin class in
# the below setting. To configure the enabled plugin(s) visit the configuration file(s)
# listed above. See the DSpace Configuration Documentation for more details.
#
# Uncomment any of the below plugins to enable them (or copy to your local.cfg).
# You may also reorder them by simply changing their order within this file, or
# defining a new order in local.cfg.

# IP-based authentication/authorization. See authentication-ip.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.IPAuthentication

# LDAP authentication/authorization. See authentication-ldap.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.LDAPAuthentication

# Shibboleth authentication/authorization. See authentication-shibboleth.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.ShibAuthentication

# X.509 certificate authentication. See authentication-x509.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.X509Authentication

# Authentication by Password (encrypted in DSpace's database). See authentication-password.cfg for default configuration.
# Enabled by default (to disable, either comment out, or define a new list of AuthenticationMethod plugins in your local.cfg)
plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication

#---------------Stateless JWT Authentication--------------------#
#---------------------------------------------------------------#

# Server key part that is a part of the key used to sign the authentication tokens.
# If this property is not set or empty, DSpace will generate a random key on startup.
# IF YOU ARE RUNNING DSPACE IN A CLUSTER, you need to set a value for this property here or as an environment variable
# jwt.token.secret =

# This property enables/disables encryption of the payload in a stateless token. Enabling this makes the data encrypted
# and unreadable by the receiver, but makes the token larger in size. false by default
jwt.encryption.enabled = false

# Encryption key to use when JWT token encryption is enabled (JWE). Note that encrypting tokens might required additional
# configuration in the REST clients
# jwt.encryption.secret =

# This enables compression of the payload of a jwt, enabling this will make the jwt token a little smaller at the cost
# of some performance, this setting WILL ONLY BE used when encrypting the jwt.
jwt.compression.enabled = true

# Expiration time of a token in minutes
jwt.token.expiration = 30

# Restrict tokens to a specific ip-address to prevent theft/session hijacking. This is achieved by making the ip-address
# a part of the JWT siging key. If this property is set to false then the ip-address won't be used as part of
# the signing key of a jwt token and tokens can be shared over multiple ip-addresses.
# For security reasons, this defaults to true
jwt.token.include.ip = true
