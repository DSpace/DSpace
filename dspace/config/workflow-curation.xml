 <!-- workflow-curation assigns Curation Tasks to DSpace workflow steps.     -->

 <!-- The taskset-map element maps collection handles to tasksets enumerated -->
 <!-- in the 'tasksets' element. The special collection handle 'default' is  -->
 <!-- matched when a collection is not otherwise mapped.  The special        -->
 <!-- taskset name 'none' indicates that there is no taskset to perform.     -->

 <taskset-map>
   <mapping collection-handle="default" taskset="none" />
 </taskset-map>

 <!-- Tasksets specify curation tasks to be automatically performed at       -->
 <!-- specific stages of workflow. The taskset 'name' attribute should match -->
 <!-- the 'taskset' attribute in the task-set mapping above.                 -->

 <!-- Tasksets are organized into elements called 'flowsteps' which          -->
 <!-- correspond by name to DSpace workflow steps. Thus, to cause a task to  -->
 <!-- be performed in the workflow step 'edit', place a 'task' element in    -->
 <!-- the 'edit' flowstep.                                                   -->
 <!--                                                                        -->
 <!-- You may define a flowstep element in a taskset for each step in the    -->
 <!-- workflow, since the flowstep action occurs before its workflow step.   -->
 <!-- Use 'archive' for tasks to run just before the item is installed in    -->
 <!-- archive.                                                               -->
 <!--                                                                        -->
 <!-- Each flowstep also allows an optional 'queue' attribute, which         -->
 <!-- controls whether and where the tasks are placed on a queue for         -->
 <!-- deferred performance. If the attribute is not present, the tasks are   -->
 <!-- all performed immediately. Otherwise, the tasks are placed on a queue  -->
 <!-- named by the attribute value.                                          -->
 <!--                                                                        -->
 <!-- You may add any number of tasks to a flowstep.-->

 <!-- Each task element has a mandatory name attribute and two optional,     -->
 <!-- repeatable children. The task name attribute must match the plugin     -->
 <!-- manager name given the task in dspace.cfg.                             -->
 <!--                                                                        -->
 <!-- The 'workflow' element describes what workflow actions can be taken    -->
 <!-- upon completion of the task. In the example below, the vscan (virus    -->
 <!-- scan) task has been given the power to 'reject': meaning that if the   -->
 <!-- task fails - viz. a virus is detected - the item will be rejected like -->
 <!-- a reviewer would reject it.                                            -->
 <!-- The other 'workflow' value is 'approve', which skips any further tasks -->
 <!-- and advances the item.                                                 -->
 <!--                                                                        -->
 <!-- The 'notify' element allows you use the workflow system of             -->
 <!-- notifications (email) whenever a task is performed and returns the     -->
 <!-- designated status code (in the 'on' attribute): 'fail', 'success' or   -->
 <!-- 'error'.                                                               -->
 <!-- The content of these elements must be one of the following types:      -->
 <!-- an eperson name, an eperson group, or one of the special literals:     -->
 <!-- '$flowgroup' = the workflow group of the step (if any).                -->
 <!-- '$colladmin' = the collection administrator's group (if any)           -->
 <!-- '$siteadmin' = the site administrator                                  -->

 <!-- Thus, a recap of the sample taskset below would be: run a virus scan   -->
 <!-- on every submitted item, reject infected submissions, notify the       -->
 <!-- reviewer's group and collection administrators of same, or the site    -->
 <!-- administrator if the task encounters an error in processing            -->
