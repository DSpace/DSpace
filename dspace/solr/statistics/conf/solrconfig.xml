       plugin jars with dependencies on other jars, the "lower level" 
       dependency jars should be loaded first.

       for better NRT performance.

       solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory, or solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory.

  <!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
       index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, its a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.

         <str name="managedSchemaResourceName">managed-schema</str>
       </schemaFactory>
       
       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified, Solr will load the schema from
       he resource named in 'managedSchemaResourceName', rather than from schema.xml.
       Note that the managed schema resource CANNOT be named schema.xml.  If the managed
       schema does not exist, Solr will create it after reading schema.xml, then rename
       'schema.xml' to 'schema.xml.bak'. 
       
       Do NOT hand edit the managed schema - external modifications will be ignored and
       overwritten as a result of schema modification REST API calls.

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified with mutable = true, schema
       modification REST API calls will be allowed; otherwise, error responses will be
       sent back for these requests.

       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent

       IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be
       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a

 <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

       handleSelect is a legacy option that affects the behavior of requests
       such as /select?qt=XXX

       handleSelect="true" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to process
       the request and dispatch the query to a handler specified by the 
       "qt" param, assuming "/select" isn't already registered.

       handleSelect="false" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to
       ignore "/select" requests, resulting in a 404 unless a handler
       is explicitly registered with the name "/select"

       handleSelect="true" is not recommended for new users, but is the default
       for backwards compatibility
    -->
  <requestDispatcher handleSelect="false" >
    <!-- Request Parsing

         These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
         those requests

         enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

         multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.
         
         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.
         
         addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
         the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
         object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the 
         key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
         Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom 
         plugins.
         
         *** WARNING ***
         The settings below authorize Solr to fetch remote files, You
         should make sure your system has some authentication before
         using enableRemoteStreaming="true"

      --> 
    <requestParsers enableRemoteStreaming="true"

                    addHttpRequestToContext="false"/>

    <!-- HTTP Caching

         Set HTTP caching related parameters (for proxy caches and clients).

         The options below instruct Solr not to output any HTTP Caching
         related headers
      -->
    <httpCaching never304="true" />
    <!-- If you include a <cacheControl> directive, it will be used to
         generate a Cache-Control header (as well as an Expires header
         if the value contains "max-age=")
         
         By default, no Cache-Control header is generated.
         
         You can use the <cacheControl> option even if you have set
         never304="true"
      -->
    <!--
       <httpCaching never304="true" >
         <cacheControl>max-age=30, public</cacheControl>

      -->
    <!-- To enable Solr to respond with automatically generated HTTP
         Caching headers, and to response to Cache Validation requests
         correctly, set the value of never304="false"
         
         This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
         headers based on the properties of the Index.

         The following options can also be specified to affect the
         values of these headers...

         lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
         Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
         requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
         was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

         (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
         the never304="true" option)
      -->
    <!--
       <httpCaching lastModifiedFrom="openTime"
                    etagSeed="Solr">

  <!-- Request Handlers 

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".

       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.

  <!-- SearchHandler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SearchHandler

       For processing Search Queries, the primary Request Handler
       provided with Solr is "SearchHandler" It delegates to a sequent
       of SearchComponents (see below) and supports distributed
       queries across multiple shards
    -->
  <requestHandler name="/select" class="solr.SearchHandler">

         will be overridden by parameters in the request

         to identify values which should be appended to the list of
         multi-val params from the query (or the existing "defaults").

    <!-- In this example, the param "fq=instock:true" would be appended to
         any query time fq params the user may specify, as a mechanism for
         partitioning the index, independent of any user selected filtering
         that may also be desired (perhaps as a result of faceted searching).

         NOTE: there is *absolutely* nothing a client can do to prevent these
         "appends" values from being used, so don't use this mechanism
         unless you are sure you always want it.

         specified here are used regardless of what values may be specified
         in either the query, the "defaults", or the "appends" params.

         In this example, the facet.field and facet.query params would
         be fixed, limiting the facets clients can use.  Faceting is
         not turned on by default - but if the client does specify
         facet=true in the request, these are the only facets they
         will be able to see counts for; regardless of what other
         facet.field or facet.query params they may specify.

         NOTE: there is *absolutely* nothing a client can do to prevent these
