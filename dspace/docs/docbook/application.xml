      <para>The DSpace Web UI is the largest and most-used component in the application layer. Built on Java Servlet and JavaServer Page technology, it allows end-users to access DSpace over the Web via their Web browsers. As of Dspace 1.3.2 the UI meets both XHTML 1.0 standards and Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) level-2 standard.</para>
      <para>It also features an administration section, consisting of pages intended for use by central administrators. Presently, this part of the Web UI is not particularly sophisticated; users of the administration section need to know what they are doing! Selected parts of this may also be used by collection administrators.</para>

        <title>Web UI Files</title>
        <para>The Web UI-related files are located in a variety of directories in the DSpace source tree. Note that as of DSpace version 1.2, the deployment mechanism has changed; the build process creates easy-to-deploy Web application archives (<literal>.war</literal> files).</para>

        <title>Servlets and JSPs</title>
        <para>The Web UI is loosely based around the MVC (model, view, controller) model. The content management API corresponds to the model, the Java Servlets are the controllers, and the JSPs are the views. Interactions take the following basic form:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para> An HTTP request is received from a browser</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> The appropriate servlet is invoked, and processes the request by invoking the DSpace business logic layer public API</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Depending on the outcome of the processing, the servlet invokes the appropriate JSP</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> The JSP is processed and sent to the browser</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>The reasons for this approach are:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para> All of the processing is done before the JSP is invoked, so any error or problem that occurs does not occur halfway through HTML rendering</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> The JSPs contain as little code as possible, so they can be customized without having to delve into Java code too much</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>The <literal>org.dspace.app.webui.servlet.LoadDSpaceConfig</literal> servlet is always loaded first. This is a very simple servlet that checks the <literal>dspace-config</literal> context parameter from the DSpace deployment descriptor, and uses it to locate <literal>dspace.cfg</literal>. It also loads up the Log4j configuration. It&apos;s important that this servlet is loaded first, since if another servlet is loaded up, it will cause the system to try and load DSpace and Log4j configurations, neither of which would be found.</para>
        <para>All DSpace servlets are subclasses of the <literal>DSpaceServlet</literal> class. The <literal>DSpaceServlet</literal> class handles some basic operations such as creating a DSpace <literal>Context</literal> object (opening a database connection etc.), authentication and error handling. Instead of overriding the <literal>doGet</literal> and <literal>doPost</literal> methods as one normally would for a servlet, DSpace servlets implement <literal>doDSGet</literal> or <literal>doDSPost</literal> which have an extra context parameter, and allow the servlet to throw various exceptions that can be handled in a standard way.</para>
        <para>The DSpace servlet processes the contents of the HTTP request. This might involve retrieving the results of a search with a query term, accessing the current user&apos;s eperson record, or updating a submission in progress. According to the results of this processing, the servlet must decide which JSP should be displayed. The servlet then fills out the appropriate attributes in the <literal>HttpRequest</literal> object that represents the HTTP request being processed. This is done by invoking the <literal>setAttribute</literal> method of the <literal>javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest</literal> object that is passed into the servlet from Tomcat. The servlet then forwards control of the request to the appropriate JSP using the <literal>JSPManager.showJSP</literal> method.</para>
        <para>The <literal>JSPManager.showJSP</literal> method uses the standard Java servlet forwarding mechanism is then used to forward the HTTP request to the JSP. The JSP is processed by Tomcat and the results sent back to the user&apos;s browser.</para>
        <para>There is an exception to this servlet/JSP style: <literal>index.jsp</literal>, the &apos;home page&apos;, receives the HTTP request directly from Tomcat without a servlet being invoked first. This is because in the servlet 2.3 specification, there is no way to map a servlet to handle only requests made to &apos;<literal>/</literal>&apos;; such a mapping results in every request being directed to that servlet. By default, Tomcat forwards requests to &apos;<literal>/</literal>&apos; to <literal>index.jsp</literal>. To try and make things as clean as possible, <literal>index.jsp</literal> contains some simple code that would normally go in a servlet, and then forwards to <literal>home.jsp</literal> using the <literal>JSPManager.showJSP</literal> method. This means localized versions of the &apos;home page&apos; can be created by placing a customized <literal>home.jsp</literal> in <literal>[dspace-source]/jsp/local</literal>, in the same manner as other JSPs.</para>
        <para><literal>[dspace-source]/jsp/dspace-admin/index.jsp</literal>, the administration UI index page, is invoked directly by Tomcat and not through a servlet for similar reasons.</para>
        <para>At the top of each JSP file, right after the license and copyright header, is documented the appropriate attributes that a servlet must fill out prior to forwarding to that JSP. No validation is performed; if the servlet does not fill out the necessary attributes, it is likely that an internal server error will occur.</para>
        <para>Many JSPs containing forms will include hidden parameters that tell the servlets which form has been filled out. The submission UI servlet (<literal>SubmissionController</literal> is a prime example of a servlet that deals with the input from many different JSPs. The <literal>step</literal> and <literal>page</literal> hidden parameters (written out by the <literal>SubmissionController.getSubmissionParameters()</literal> method) are used to inform the servlet which page of which step has just been filled out (i.e. which page of the submission the user has just completed).</para>
        <para>Below is a detailed, scary diagram depicting the flow of control during the whole process of processing and responding to an HTTP request. More information about the authentication mechanism is mostly <link linkend="docbook-configure.html-authenticate">described in the configuration section</link>.</para>

        <title>Custom JSP Tags</title>
        <para>The DSpace JSPs all use some custom tags defined in <literal>/dspace/jsp/WEB-INF/dspace-tags.tld</literal>, and the corresponding Java classes reside in <literal>org.dspace.app.webui.jsptag</literal>.

            </term>
            <listitem>
              <para> Just about every JSP uses this tag. It produces the standard HTML header and <literal>&lt;BODY&gt;</literal>tag. Thus the content of each JSP is nested inside a <literal>&lt;dspace:layout&gt;</literal> tag. The (XML-style)attributes of this tag are slightly complicated--see <literal>dspace-tags.tld</literal>. The JSPs in the source code bundle also provide plenty of examples.</para>

              <para> Obsolete, simple tag, similar to <literal>jsp:include</literal>. In versions prior to DSpace 1.2, this tag would use the locally modified version of a JSP if one was installed in jsp/local. As of 1.2, the build process now performs this function, however this tag is left in for backwards compatibility.</para>

              <para> Displays an item record, including Dublin Core metadata and links to the bitstreams within it. Note that the displaying of the bitstream links is simplistic, and does not take into account any of the bundling structure. This is because DSpace does not have a fully-fledged dissemination architectural piece yet.</para>
              <para>Displaying an item record is done by a tag rather than a JSP for two reasons: Firstly, it happens in several places (when verifying an item record during submission or workflow review, as well as during standard item accesses), and secondly, displaying the item turns out to be mostly code-work rather than HTML anyway. Of course, the disadvantage of doing it this way is that it is slightly harder to customize exactly what is displayed from an item record; it is necessary to edit the tag code (<literal>org.dspace.app.webui.jsptag.ItemTag</literal>). Hopefully a better solution can be found in the future.</para>

            </term>
            <listitem>
              <para> This tag is used to render a link to a pop-up page (typically a help page.) If Javascript is available, the link will either open or pop to the front any existing DSpace pop-up window. If Javascript is not available, a standard HTML link is displayed that renders the link destination in a window named &apos;<literal>dspace.popup</literal>&apos;. In graphical browsers, this usually opens a new window or re-uses an existing window of that name, but if a window is re-used it is not &apos;raised&apos; which might confuse the user. In text browsers, following this link will simply replace the current page with the destination of the link. This obviously means that Javascript offers the best functionality, but other browsers are still supported.</para>

        <para>The end user&apos;s browser settings determine which language is used.

        <para>The <literal>dspace:layout</literal> tag has been updated to allow dictionary keys to be passed in for the titles. It now has two new parameters: <literal>titlekey</literal> and <literal>parenttitlekey</literal>. So where before you&apos;d do:</para>

        <title>HTML Content in Items</title>
        <para>For the most part, the DSpace item display just gives a link that allows an end-user to download a bitstream. However, if a bundle has a primary bitstream whose format is of MIME type <literal>text/html</literal>, instead a link to the HTML servlet is given.</para>
        <para>So if we had an HTML document like this:</para>
        <screen>
contents.html
chapter1.html
chapter2.html
chapter3.html
figure1.gif
figure2.jpg
figure3.gif
figure4.jpg
figure5.gif
figure6.gif
</screen>
        <para>The Bundle&apos;s primary bitstream field would point to the contents.html Bitstream, which we know is HTML (check the format MIME type) and so we know which to serve up first.</para>
        <para>The HTML servlet employs a trick to serve up HTML documents without actually modifying the HTML or other files themselves. Say someone is looking at <literal>contents.html</literal> from the above example, the URL in their browser will look like this:</para>
        <screen>
https://dspace.mit.edu/html/1721.1/12345/contents.html
</screen>
        <para>If there&apos;s an image called <literal>figure1.gif</literal> in that HTML page, the browser will do HTTP GET on this URL:</para>
        <screen>
https://dspace.mit.edu/html/1721.1/12345/figure1.gif
</screen>
        <para>The HTML document servlet can work out which item the user is looking at, and then which Bitstream in it is called <literal>figure1.gif</literal>, and serve up that bitstream. Similar for following links to other HTML pages. Of course all the links and image references have to be relative and not absolute.</para>
        <para>HTML documents must be &quot;self-contained&quot;, as <link linkend="docbook-functional.html-html">explained here</link>. Provided that full path information is known by DSpace, any depth or complexity of HTML document can be served subject to those contraints. This is usually possible with some kind of batch import. If, however, the document has been uploaded one file at a time using the Web UI, the path information has been stripped. The system can cope with relative links that refer to a deeper path, e.g.</para>
        <screen>
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;images/figure1.gif&quot;&gt;
</screen>
        <para>If the item has been uploaded via the Web submit UI, in the Bitstream table in the database we have the &apos;name&apos; field, which will contain the filename with no path (<literal>figure1.gif</literal>). We can still work out what <literal>images/figure1.gif</literal> is by making the HTML document servlet strip any path that comes in from the URL, e.g.</para>
        <screen>
https://dspace.mit.edu/html/1721.1/12345/images/figure1.gif
                                         ^^^^^^^
                                        Strip this
</screen>
        <para>BUT all the filenames (regardless of directory names) must be unique. For example, this wouldn&apos;t work:</para>
        <screen>
contents.html
chapter1.html
chapter2.html
chapter1_images/figure.gif
chapter2_images/figure.gif
</screen>
        <para>since the HTML document servlet wouldn&apos;t know which bitstream to serve up for:</para>
        <screen>
https://dspace.mit.edu/html/1721.1/12345/chapter1_images/figure.gif
https://dspace.mit.edu/html/1721.1/12345/chapter2_images/figure.gif
</screen>
        <para>since it would just have <literal>figure.gif</literal></para>
        <para>To prevent &quot;infinite URL spaces&quot; appearing (e.g. if a file <literal>foo.html</literal> linked to <literal>bar/foo.html</literal>, which would link to <literal>bar/bar/foo.html</literal>...) this behavior can be configured by setting the configuration property <literal>webui.html.max-depth-guess</literal>.</para>
        <para>For example, if we receive a request for <literal>foo/bar/index.html</literal>, and we have a bitstream called just <literal>index.html</literal>, we will serve up that bitstream for the request if <literal>webui.html.max-depth-guess</literal> is 2 or greater. If <literal>webui.html.max-depth-guess</literal> is 1 or less, we would not serve that bitstream, as the depth of the file is greater. If <literal>webui.html.max-depth-guess</literal> is zero, the request filename and path must always exactly match the bitstream name. The default value (if that property is not present in <literal>dspace.cfg</literal>) is 3.</para>

      <para>The DSpace platform supports the <ulink url="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</ulink> (OAI-PMH) version 2.0 as a data provider. This is accomplished using the <ulink url="http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm">OAICat framework from OCLC</ulink>.</para>
      <para>The DSpace build process builds a Web application archive, <literal>[dspace-source]/build/oai.war</literal>), in much the same way as <link linkend="docbook-application.html-webui_build">the Web UI build process</link> described above. The only differences are that the JSPs are not included, and <literal>[dspace-source]/etc/oai-web.xml</literal> is used as the deployment descriptor. This &apos;webapp&apos; is deployed to receive and respond to OAI-PMH requests via HTTP. Note that typically it should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be deployed on SSL (<literal>https:</literal> protocol). In a typical configuration, this is deployed at <literal>oai</literal>, for example:</para>
      <screen>
http://dspace.myu.edu/oai/request?verb=Identify
</screen>
      <para>The &apos;base URL&apos; of this DSpace deployment would be:</para>
      <screen>
http://dspace.myu.edu/oai/request
</screen>
      <para>It is this URL that should be registered with <ulink url="http://www.openarchives.org/">www.openarchives.org</ulink>. Note that you can easily change the &apos;<literal>request</literal>&apos; portion of the URL by editing <literal>[dspace-source]/etc/oai-web.xml</literal> and rebuilding and deploying <literal>oai.war</literal>.</para>
      <para>DSpace provides implementations of the OAICat interfaces <literal>AbstractCatalog</literal>, <literal>RecordFactory</literal> and <literal>Crosswalk</literal> that interface with the DSpace content management API and harvesting API (in the search subsystem).</para>
      <para>Only the basic <literal>oai_dc</literal> unqualified Dublin Core metadata set export is enabled by default; this is particularly easy since all items have qualified Dublin Core metadata. When this metadata is harvested, the qualifiers are simply stripped; for example, <literal>description.abstract</literal> is exposed as unqualified <literal>description</literal>. The <literal>description.provenance</literal> field is hidden, as this contains private information about the submitter and workflow reviewers of the item, including their e-mail addresses. Additionally, to keep in line with OAI community practices, values of <literal>contributor.author</literal> are exposed as <literal>creator</literal> values.</para>
      <para>Other metadata formats are supported as well, using other <literal>Crosswalk</literal> implementations; consult the <literal>oaicat.properties</literal> file described below. To enable a format, simply uncomment the lines beginning with <literal>Crosswalks.*</literal>. Multiple formats are allowed, and the current list includes, in addition to unqualified DC: MPEG DIDL, METS, MODS. There is also an incomplete, experimental qualified DC.</para>
      <para>Note that the current simple DC implementation (<literal>org.dspace.app.oai.OAIDCCrosswalk</literal>) does not currently strip out any invalid XML characters that may be lying around in the data. If your database contains a DC value with, for example, some ASCII control codes (form feed etc.) this may cause OAI harvesters problems. This should rarely occur, however. XML entities (such as <literal>&gt;</literal>) are encoded (e.g. to <literal>&amp;gt;</literal>)</para>

        <title>Unique Identifier</title>
        <para>Every item in OAI-PMH data repository must have an unique identifier, which must conform to the URI syntax. As of DSpace 1.2, Handles are not used; this is because in OAI-PMH, the OAI identifier identifies the <emphasis>metadata record</emphasis> associated with the <emphasis>resource</emphasis>. The <emphasis>resource</emphasis> is the DSpace item, whose <emphasis>resource identifier</emphasis> is the Handle. In practical terms, using the Handle for the OAI identifier may cause problems in the future if DSpace instances share items with the same Handles; the OAI metadata record identifiers should be different as the different DSpace instances would need to be harvested separately and may have different metadata for the item.</para>
        <para>The OAI identifiers that DSpace uses are of the form:</para>
        <para>
          <literal>oai:host name:handle</literal>
        </para>
        <para>For example:</para>

        <title>Access control</title>
        <para>OAI provides no authentication/authorisation details, although these could be implemented using standard HTTP methods. It is assumed that all access will be anonymous for the time being.</para>
        <para>A question is, &quot;is all metadata public?&quot; Presently the answer to this is yes; all metadata is exposed via OAI-PMH, even if the item has restricted access policies. The reasoning behind this is that people who do actually have permission to read a restricted item should still be able to use OAI-based services to discover the content.</para>
        <para>If in the future, this &apos;expose all metadata&apos; approach proves unsatisfactory for any reason, it should be possible to expose only publicly readable metadata. The authorisation system has separate permissions for READing and item and READing the content (bitstreams) within it. This means the system can differentiate between an item with public metadata and hidden content, and an item with hidden metadata as well as hidden content. In this case the OAI data repository should only expose items those with anonymous READ access, so it can hide the existence of records to the outside world completely. In this scenario, one should be wary of protected items that are made public after a time. When this happens, the items are &quot;new&quot; from the OAI-PMH perspective.</para>

        <title>Modification Date (OAI Date Stamp)</title>
        <para>OAI-PMH harvesters need to know when a record has been created, changed or deleted. DSpace keeps track of a &apos;last modified&apos; date for each item in the system, and this date is used for the OAI-PMH date stamp. This means that any changes to the metadata (e.g. admins correcting a field, or a withdrawal) will be exposed to harvesters.</para>
      </section>
      <section remap="h3">
        <title>&apos;About&apos; Information</title>
        <para>As part of each record given out to a harvester, there is an optional, repeatable &quot;about&quot; section which can be filled out in any (XML-schema conformant) way. Common uses are for provenance and rights information, and there are schemas in use by OAI communities for this. Presently DSpace does not provide any of this information.</para>
      </section>
      <section remap="h3">
        <title>Deletions</title>
        <para>DSpace keeps track of deletions (withdrawals). These are exposed via OAI, which has a specific mechansim for dealing with this. Since DSpace keeps a permanent record of withdrawn items, in the OAI-PMH sense DSpace supports deletions &apos;persistently&apos;. This is as opposed to &apos;transient&apos; deletion support, which would mean that deleted records are forgotten after a time.</para>
        <para>Once an item has been withdrawn, OAI-PMH harvests of the date range in which the withdrawal occurred will find the &apos;deleted&apos; record header. Harvests of a date range prior to the withdrawal will <emphasis>not</emphasis> find the record, despite the fact that the record did exist at that time.</para>
        <para>As an example of this, consider an item that was created on 2002-05-02 and withdrawn on 2002-10-06. A request to harvest the month 2002-10 will yield the &apos;record deleted&apos; header. However, a harvest of the month 2002-05 will not yield the original record.</para>
        <para>Note that presently, the deletion of &apos;expunged&apos; items is not exposed through OAI.</para>

        <title>Flow Control (Resumption Tokens)</title>
        <para>An OAI data provider can prevent any performance impact caused by harvesting by forcing a harvester to receive data in time-separated chunks. If the data provider receives a request for a lot of data, it can send part of the data with a resumption token. The harvester can then return later with the resumption token and continue.</para>
        <para>DSpace supports resumption tokens for &apos;ListRecords&apos; OAI-PMH requests. ListIdentifiers and ListSets requests do not produce a particularly high load on the system, so resumption tokens are not used for those requests.</para>
        <para>Each OAI-PMH ListRecords request will return at most 100 records. This limit is set at the top of <literal>org.dspace.app.oai.DSpaceOAICatalog.java</literal> (<literal>MAX_RECORDS</literal>). A potential issue here is that if a harvest yields an exact multiple of <literal>MAX_RECORDS</literal>, the last operation will result in a harvest with no records in it. It is unclear from the OAI-PMH specification if this is acceptable.</para>
        <para>When a resumption token is issued, the optional <literal>completeListSize</literal> and <literal>cursor</literal> attributes are not included. OAICat sets the <literal>expirationDate</literal> of the resumption token to one hour after it was issued, though in fact since DSpace resumption tokens contain all the information required to continue a request they do not actually expire.</para>
        <para>Resumption tokens contain all the state information required to continue a request. The format is:</para>
        <screen>
from/until/setSpec/offset
</screen>
        <para><literal>from</literal> and <literal>until</literal> are the ISO 8601 dates passed in as part of the original request, and <literal>setSpec</literal> is also taken from the original request. <literal>offset</literal> is the number of records that have already been sent to the harvester. For example:</para>
        <screen>
2003-01-01//hdl_1721_1_1234/300
</screen>
        <para>This means the harvest is &apos;from&apos; <literal>2003-01-01</literal>, has no &apos;until&apos; date, is for collection hdl:1721.1/1234, and 300 records have already been sent to the harvester. (Actually, if the original OAI-PMH request doesn&apos;t specify a &apos;from&apos; or &apos;until, OAICat fills them out automatically to &apos;0000-00-00T00:00:00Z&apos; and &apos;9999-12-31T23:59:59Z&apos; respectively. This means DSpace resumption tokens will always have from and until dates in them.)</para>

        <para>The item importer is in <literal>org.dspace.app.itemimport.ItemImport</literal>, and is run with the <literal>import</literal> utility in the <literal>dspace/bin</literal> directory. Running it with -h gets the current command-line arguments. Another very important flag is the --test flag, which you can use with any command to simulate all of the actions it will perform without actually making any changes to your DSpace instance - very useful for validating your item directories before doing an import. In the importer&apos;s arguments you can use either the user&apos;s database ID or email address and the eperson ID, and the collection&apos;s database ID or handle as arguments. Currently with the importer you can add, remove, and replace items in a collection. If you specify more than one collection argument then the items will be imported to multiple collections, and the first collection specified becomes the &quot;owning&quot; collection. If there is an error and the import is aborted, there is a --resume flag that you can try to resume the import where you left off after you fix the error.</para>

[dspace]/bin/import --delete --mapfile=mapfile

        <para>The imported items listed in the map file would then be deleted. If you wish to replace previously imported items, you can give the command:</para>

        <para>The importer usually bypasses any workflow assigned to a collection, but adding the --workflow option will route the imported items through the workflow system.</para>

      <para>Registration is an alternate means of incorporating items, their metadata, and their bitstreams into DSpace by taking advantage of the bitstreams already being in storage accessible to DSpace. An example might be that there is a repository for existing digital assets. Rather than using the normal <link linkend="docbook-functional.html-ingest">interactive ingest process</link> or the <link linkend="docbook-functional.html-importexport">batch import</link> to furnish DSpace the metadata and to upload bitstreams, registration provides DSpace the metadata and the location of the bitstreams. DSpace uses a variation of the import tool to accomplish registration.</para>
      <section remap="h3">
        <title>Accessible Storage</title>
        <para>To register an item its bitstreams must reside on storage accessible to DSpace and therefore referenced by an asset store number in <literal>dspace.cfg</literal>. The configuration file <literal>dspace.cfg</literal> establishes one or more asset stores through the use of an integer asset store number. This number relates to a directory in the DSpace host&apos;s file system or a set of SRB account parameters. This asset store number is described in <link linkend="docbook-configure.html-dspacecfg">The <literal>dspace.cfg</literal> Configuration Properties File</link> section and in the <literal>dspace.cfg</literal> file itself. The asset store number(s) used for registered items should generally not be the value of the <literal>assetstore.incoming</literal> property since it is unlikely that that you will want to mix the bitstreams of normally ingested and imported items and registered items.</para>

        <title>Registering Items Using the Item Importer</title>
        <para>DSpace uses the same import tool that is used for batch import except that several variations are employed to support registration. The discussion that follows assumes familiarity with the import tool.</para>
        <para>The archive format for registration does not include the actual content files (bitstreams) being registered. The format is however a directory full of items to be registered, with a subdirectory per item.

        <title>Internal Identification and Retrieval of Registered Items</title>
        <para>Once an item has been registered, superficially it is indistinguishable from items ingested interactively or by batch import. But internally there are some differences:</para>
        <para>First, the randomly generated internal ID is not used because DSpace does not control the file path and name of the bitstream. Instead, the file path and name are that specified in the <literal>contents</literal> file.</para>
        <para>Second, the <literal>store_number</literal> column of the bitstream database row contains the asset store number specified in the <literal>contents</literal> file.</para>
        <para>Third, the <literal>internal_id</literal> column of the bitstream database row contains a leading flag (<literal>-R</literal>) followed by the registered file path and name. For example, <literal>-Rfilepath</literal> where <literal>filepath</literal> is the file path and name relative to the asset store corresponding to the asset store number. The asset store could be traditional storage in the DSpace server&apos;s file system or an SRB account.</para>
        <para>Fourth, an MD5 checksum is calculated by reading the registered file if it is in local storage. If the registerd file is in remote storage (say, SRB) a checksum is calulated on just the file name! This is an efficiency choice since registering a large number of large files that are in SRB would consume substantial network resources and time. A future option could be to have an SRB proxy process calculate MD5s and store them in SRB&apos;s metadata catalog (MCAT) for rapid retrieval. SRB offers such an option but it&apos;s not yet in production release.</para>
        <para>Registered items and their bitstreams can be retrieved transparently just like normally ingested items.</para>

Management"/>Sub-Community Management</title>
      <para>DSpace provides an administrative tool - &apos;CommunityFiliator&apos; - for managing community sub-structure. Normally this structure seldom changes, but prior to the 1.2 release sub-communities were not supported, so this tool could be used to place existing pre-1.2 communities into a hierarchy. It has two operations, either establishing a community to sub-community relationship, or dis-establishing an existing relationship.</para>
      <para>The familiar parent/child metaphor can be used to explain how it works. Every community in DSpace can be either a &apos;parent&apos; community - meaning it has at least one sub-community, or a &apos;child&apos; community - meaning it is a sub-community of another community, or both or neither. In these terms, an &apos;orphan&apos; is a community that lacks a parent (although it can be a parent); &apos;orphans&apos; are referred to as &apos;top-level&apos; communities in the DSpace user-interface, since there is no parent community &apos;above&apos; them. The first operation - establishing a parent/child relationship - can take place between any community and an orphan. The second operation - removing a parent/child relationship - will make the child an orphan.</para>
      <para>Using the dsrun utility in the dspace/bin directory, the establish operation looks like this:</para>
      <screen>
dsrun org.dspace.administer.CommunityFiliator --set --parent=parentID
	--child=childID
</screen>
      <para>(or using the short form)</para>
      <screen>
dsrun org.dspace.administer.CommunityFiliator -s -p parentID -c
	childID
</screen>
      <para>where &apos;-s&apos; or &apos;--set&apos; means establish a relationship whereby the community identified by the &apos;-p&apos; parameter becomes the parent of the community identified by the &apos;-c&apos; parameter. Both the &apos;parentID&apos; and &apos;childID&apos; values may be handles or database IDs.</para>
      <para>The reverse operation looks like this:</para>
      <screen>
dsrun org.dspace.administer.CommunityFiliator --remove
	--parent=parentID --child=childID
</screen>
      <para>(or using the short form)</para>
      <screen>
dsrun org.dspace.administer.CommunityFiliator -r -p parentID -c
	childID
</screen>
      <para>where &apos;-r&apos; or &apos;--remove&apos; means dis-establish the current relationship in which the community identified by &apos;parentID&apos; is the parent of the community identified by &apos;childID&apos;. The outcome will be that the &apos;childID&apos; community will become an orphan, i.e. a top-level community.</para>
      <para>If the required constraints of operation are violated, an error message will appear explaining the problem, and no change will be made. An example in a removal operation, where the stated child community does not have the stated parent community as its parent: &quot;Error, child community not a child of parent community&quot;.</para>
      <para>It is possible to effect arbitrary changes to the community hierarchy by chaining the basic operations together. For example, to move a child community from one parent to another, simply perform a &apos;remove&apos; from its current parent (which will leave it an orphan), followed by a &apos;set&apos; to its new parent.</para>
      <para>It is important to understand that when any operation is performed, all the sub-structure of the child community follows it. Thus, if a child has itself children (sub-communities), or collections, they will all move with it to its new &apos;location&apos; in the community tree.</para>
