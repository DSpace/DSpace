  <p>There are a number of ways in which DSpace can be configured and/or customized:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Altering the configuration files in <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config</code></li>

    <li>Creating a new XMLUI (Manakin) theme to change the look-and-feel of the repository</li>

    <li>Creating modified versions of the JSP pages for local changes in the JSPUI interface</li>

    <li>Implementing a custom 'plug-in' class -- for example, an 'authenticator' class, so that user authentication in the Web UI can be adapted and integrated with any existing mechanisms your organization might use, or a 'media filter' to generate thumbnails or extract full text from a new file format</li>

    <li>Editing the source code</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Of these methods, only the last is likely to cause any headaches; if you update the DSpace source code directly, particularly core class files in <code>org.dspace.*</code> or <code>org.dspace.storage.*</code>, it may make applying future updates difficult.  Before doing this, it is strongly recommended that you <a href="http://wiki.dspace.org/DspaceResources">e-mail the DSpace developer community</a> to find out the best way to proceed, and the best way to implement your change in a way that can be <A href="http://wiki.dspace.org/HowToContribute">contributed back to DSpace</a> for everyone's benefit.</p>


  <h2><a name="general" id="general">General Configuration</a></h2>
  
  <p>These are general configuration options that apply to the core of DSpace regardless of which interface you are using (JSPUI or XMLUI). </p>

  <h3><a name="general-dspacecfg" id="general-dspacecfg">The <code>dspace.cfg</code> Configuration Properties File</a></h3>

  <p>The primary way of configuring DSpace is to edit the <code>dspace.cfg</code>. You'll definitely have to do this before you can operate DSpace properly. <code>dspace.cfg</code> contains basic information about a DSpace installation, including system path information, network host information, and other things like site name.</p>

  <p>The default <code>dspace.cfg</code> is a good source of information, and contains comments for all properties. It's a basic Java properties file, where lines are either comments, starting with a '<code>#</code>', blank lines, or property/value pairs of the form:</p>
  <pre>
property.name = property value
</pre>

  <p>The <cite>property value</cite> may contain <em>references</em> to other
  configuration properties, in the form
  <code><b>${</b></code><cite>property.name</cite><code><b>}</b></code>.
  This follows the <code>ant</code> convention of allowing references
  in property files.  A property may not refer to itself. Examples:
  <pre>
property.name = word1 ${other.property.name} more words
property2.name = ${dspace.dir}/rest/of/path
</pre>
Whenever you edit dspace.cfg in [dspace-source]/dspace/config/, you should then run 'ant init_configs' in the directory [dspace-source]/dspace/target/dspace-1.5.0-build.dir so that any changes you may have made are reflected in the configuration files of other applications, for example Apache.  You may then need to restart those applications, depending on what you changed.

  <p>Property values can include other, previously defined values, by enclosing the property name in ${...}. For example, if your dspace.cfg contains: -</p>

  <pre>
  dspace.dir = /dspace
  dspace.history = ${dspace.dir}/history
  </pre>

  <p>Then the value of the <code>dspace.history</code> property is expanded to be <code>/dspace/history</code>. This method is especially useful for handling commonly used file paths.</p>

  <p>Whenever you edit <code>dspace.cfg</code>, you should then run <code><i>[dspace]</i>/bin/install-configs</code> so that any changes you may have made are reflected in the configuration files of other applications, for example Apache. You may then need to restart those applications, depending on what you changed.</p>


  <h3><a name="general-search" id="general-search">Configuring Lucene Search Indexes</a></h3>

  <p>Search Indexes can be configured via the <code>dspace.cfg</code> file. This allows institutions to choose which DSpace metadata fields are indexed by Lucene.</p>

  <p>For example, the following entries appear in a default DSpace installation:</p>
  <pre>
search.index.1 = author:dc.contributor.*
search.index.2 = author:dc.creator.*
search.index.3 = title:dc.title.*
search.index.4 = keyword:dc.subject.*
search.index.5 = abstract:dc.description.abstract
search.index.6 = author:dc.description.statementofresponsibility
search.index.7 = series:dc.relation.ispartofseries
search.index.8 = abstract:dc.description.tableofcontents
search.index.9 = mime:dc.format.mimetype
search.index.10 = sponsor:dc.description.sponsorship
search.index.11 = id:dc.identifier.*
	</pre>

  <p>The form of each entry is <code>search.index.&lt;id&gt; = &lt;search &lt;schema&gt;field&gt;:&lt;metadata field&gt;</code> where:</p>
    <ul>
	  <li><code>&lt;id&gt;</code> is an incremental number to distinguish each search index entry</li>
	  <li><code>&lt;search field&gt;</code> is an identifier for the search field this index will correspond to</li>
	  <li><code>&lt;metadata field&gt;</code> is the DSpace metadata field to be indexed</li>
	</ul>
  <p>So in the example above, search.indexes1, 2 and 6 are configured as the <code>author</code> search field. The <code>author</code> index is created by Lucene indexing all <code>contributor</code>, <code>creator</code> and <code>description.statementofresponsibility</code> medatata fields.</p>
  <p>After changing the configuration, run <code>index-all</code> to recreate the indexes.</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> While the indexes are created, this only affects the search results and has no effect on the search components of the user interface. To add new search capability (e.g. to add a new search category to the Advanced Search) requires local customisation to the user interface.</p>


<h3><a name="general-browse" id="general-browse">Browse Configuration</a></h3>

<p>The browse indices for DSpace can be extensively configured.  This section of the configuration
allows you to take control of the indices you wish to browse on, and how you wish to present
the results.  This configuration is broken down into several parts: defining the indices, defining
the fields upon which users can sort results, defining truncation for potentially long fields (e.g. 
author lists), setting cross-links between different browse contexts (e.g. from an author's name to
a complete list of their items), how many recent submissions to display, and configuration for item
mapping browse.</p>

<h4>Defining the Indices</h4>

<p>The form is:</p>

<pre>
webui.browse.index.&lt;n&gt; = &lt;index name&gt; : \
                               &lt;schema prefix&gt;.&lt;element&gt;[.&lt;qualifier&gt;|.*] : \
                               (date | title | text) : \
                               (full | single) \
</pre>

<dl>
	<dt>index name</dt>
	<dd>
		The name by which the index will be identified.  This may be used in later configuration
		or to locate the message key for this index.
	</dd>
	<dt>&lt;schema prefix&gt;.&lt;element&gt;[.&lt;qualifier&gt;|.*]</dt>
	<dd>
		The metadata field declaration for the field to be indexed.  This will be something
		like <code>dc.date.issued</code> or <code>dc.contributor.*</code> or <code>dc.title</code>.
	</dd>
	<dt>(date | title | text)</dt>
	<dd>This refers to the datatype of the field:
		<ul>
			<li>date: the index type will be treated as a date object</li>
			<li>title: the index type will be treated like a title, which will include
					a link to the item page</li>
			<li>text: the index type will be treated as plain text.  If single mode is
					specified then this will link to the full mode list</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>(full | single)</dt>
	<dd>
		This refers to the way that the index will be displayed in the 
		browse listing.  "Full" will be the full item list as specified
		by <code>webui.itemlist.columns</code>; "single" will be a single list of
		only the indexed term.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you are customising this list beyond the default you will need to insert the text
you wish to appear in the navigation and on link and buttons describing the browse index
into the <code>Messages.properties</code> file.  The system uses parameters of the form:</p>

<pre>
browse.type.&lt;index name&gt;
</pre>

<p>The Index numbers denoted by &lt;n&gt; must start from 1 and increment by 1 continuously
thereafter.  Deviation from this rule will cause an error during installation or during
configuration update</p>

<p>This is an example configuration, as it appears by default in <code>dspace.cfg</code>.</p>

<pre>
webui.browse.index.1 = dateissued:dc.date.issued:date:full
webui.browse.index.2 = author:dc.contributor.*:text:single
webui.browse.index.3 = title:dc.title:title:full
webui.browse.index.4 = subject:dc.subject.*:text:single
webui.browse.index.5 = dateaccessioned:dc.date.accessioned:date:full
</pre>

<h4>Defining Sort Options</h4>

<p>
Sort options will be available when browsing a list of items (i.e. only in
"full" mode, not "single" mode).  You can define an arbitrary number of fields
to sort on, irrespective of which fields you display using webui.itemlist.columns</p>

<p>The format is:</p>

<pre>
webui.browse.sort-option.&lt;n&gt; = &lt;option name&gt; : \
                               &lt;schema prefix&gt;.&lt;element&gt;[.&lt;qualifier&gt;|.*] : \
                               (date | text)
</pre>

<dl>
	<dt>option name</dt>
	<dd>
		The name by which the sort option will be identified.  This may be used in later configuration
		or to locate the message key for this index.
	</dd>
	<dt>&lt;schema prefix&gt;.&lt;element&gt;[.&lt;qualifier&gt;|.*]</dt>
	<dd>
		The metadata field declaration for the field to be sorted on.  This will be something
		like <code>dc.title</code> or <code>dc.date.issued</code>.
	</dd>
	<dt>(date | text)</dt>
	<dd>This refers to the datatype of the field:
		<ul>
			<li>date: the sort type will be treated as a date object</li>
			<li>text: the sort type will be treated as plain text.</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>This is the example configuration as it appears in the default <code>dspace.cfg</code>:

<pre>				
webui.browse.sort-option.1 = title:dc.title:text
webui.browse.sort-option.2 = date:dc.date.issued:date
</pre>

<h4>Author (Multiple metadata value) Display</h4>

<p>(Note: this section actually applies to any field with multiple values, but authors are the defined case)</p>

<p>You can define which field is the author (or editor, or other repeated field) which
this configuration will deal with thus:</p>

<pre>
webui.browse.author-field = dc.contributor.*
</pre>

Replace <code>dc.contributor.*</code> with another field if appropriate.

<p>The field should be listed in the configuration for <code>webui.itemlist.columns</code>, otherwise
you will not see its effect.  It must also be defined in <code>webui.itemlist.columns</code> as being
of data type <code>text</code>, otherwise the functionality will be overriden by the specific
data type features.

<p>Now that we know which field is our author or other multiple metadata value field we can 
provide the option to truncate the number of values displayed by default.  We replace the
remaining list of values with "et al" or the language pack specific alternative.  Note that this
is just for the default, and users will have the option of changing the number displayed when
they browse the results</p>

<pre>
webui.browse.author-limit = &lt;n&gt;
</pre>

<p>Where &lt;n&gt; is an integer number of values to be displayed.  Use <code>-1</code> for unlimited (default).</p>

<h4>Links to other browse contexts</h4>

<p>We can define which fields link to other browse listings.  This is useful, for example,
to link an author's name to a list of just that author's items.
The effect this has is to create links to browse views for the item clicked on.
If it is a "single" type, it will link to a view of all the items which share
that metadata element in common (i.e. all the papers by a single author).  If 
it is a "full" type, it will link to a view of the standard full browse page,
starting with the value of the link clicked on.</p>

<p>The form is:</p>

<pre>
webui.browse.link.&lt;n&gt; = &lt;index name&gt;:&lt;display column metadata&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This should associated
the name of one of the browse indices (<code>webui.browse.index.n</code>) with a metadata field listed
in <code>webui.itemlist.columns</code> above.  If this condition is not fulfilled, cross-linking
will not work.  Note also that cross-linking only works for metadata fields not tagged as <code>title</code> in
<code>webui.itemlist.columns</code>.

<p>The following example shows the default in <code>dspace.cfg</code> which links author
names to lists of their publications:</p>

<pre>
webui.browse.link.1 = author:dc.contributor.*
</pre>

<h4>Recent Submissions</h4>

<p>This allows us to define which index to base Recent Submission display on,
and how many we should show at any one time.  This uses the PluginManager to
automatically load the relevant plugin for the Community and Collection home
pages.  Values given in examples are the defaults supplied in <code>dspace.cfg</code></p>

<p>First define the sort name (from <code>webui.browse.sort-option</code>) to use for
# displaying recent submissions.  For example:</p>

<pre>
recent.submissions.sort-option = dateaccessioned
</pre>

<p>Define how many recent submissions should be displayed at any one time,
for example:</p>

<pre>
recent.submissions.count = 5
</pre>

<p>Now we need to set up the processors that the <a href="business.html#plugin">PluginManager</a> will load to
actually perform the recent submissions query on the relevant pages.</p>

<p>Tell the community and collection pages that we are using the Recent Submissions code

<pre>
plugin.sequence.org.dspace.plugin.CommunityHomeProcessor = \
	org.dspace.app.webui.components.RecentCommunitySubmissions

plugin.sequence.org.dspace.plugin.CollectionHomeProcessor = \
	org.dspace.app.webui.components.RecentCollectionSubmissions
</pre>

<p>This is already configured by default in <code>dspace.cfg</code> so there should be no
need for you to worry about it</p>

<h4>Item Mapper</h4>

<p>Because the item mapper requires a primitive implementation of the browse
system to be present, we simply need to tell that system which of our indices
defines the author browse (or equivalent) so that the mapper can list authors'
items for mapping</p>

<p>Define the the index name (from <code>webui.browse.index</code>) to use for
displaying items by author

<pre>
itemmap.author.index = author
</pre>

<p>So if you change the name of your author browse field, you will also need to
update this configuration.</p>

<h3><a name="general-mediafilter" id="general-mediafilter">Configuring Media Filters</a></h3>
  
  <p>Media or Format Filters are classes used to generate derivative or alternative versions of content or bitstreams within DSpace. For example, the PDF Media Filter will extract textual content from PDF bitstreams, the JPEG Media Filter can create thumbnails from image bitstreams.</p>

  <p>Media Filters are configured as <a href="business.html#plugin">Named Plugins</a>, with each filter also having a separate configuration setting (in <code>dspace.cfg</code>) indicating which formats it can process. The default configuration is shown below.</p>

<p><pre>
	#### Media Filter / Format Filter plugins (through PluginManager) ####

	#Names of the enabled MediaFilter or FormatFilter plugins
	filter.plugins = PDF Text Extractor, HTML Text Extractor, \
						Word Text Extractor, JPEG Thumbnail
	# to enable branded preview: remove last line above, and uncomment 2 lines below
	#   					Word Text Extractor, JPEG Thumbnail, \
	#   					Branded Preview JPEG

	#Assign 'human-understandable' names to each filter
	plugin.named.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.FormatFilter = \
  		org.dspace.app.mediafilter.PDFFilter = PDF Text Extractor, \
  		org.dspace.app.mediafilter.HTMLFilter = HTML Text Extractor, \
  		org.dspace.app.mediafilter.WordFilter = Word Text Extractor, \
  		org.dspace.app.mediafilter.JPEGFilter = JPEG Thumbnail, \
  		org.dspace.app.mediafilter.BrandedPreviewJPEGFilter = Branded Preview JPEG

	#Configure each filter's input format(s)
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.PDFFilter.inputFormats = Adobe PDF
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.HTMLFilter.inputFormats = HTML, Text
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.WordFilter.inputFormats = Microsoft Word
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.JPEGFilter.inputFormats = GIF, JPEG, image/png
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.BrandedPreviewJPEGFilter.inputFormats = GIF, JPEG, image/png</pre></p>

<p>The enabled Media/Format Filters are named in the <code>filter.plugins</code> field above.</p>
<p>Names are assigned to each filter using the <code>plugin.named.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.FormatFilter</code> field
(e.g. by default the <code>PDFFilter</code> is named "PDF Text Extractor").</p>  
<p>Finally the appropriate <code>filter.<em>&lt;class path&gt;</em>.inputFormats</code> defines the vaild input formats which each filter can be applied to.  These
format names <strong>must match</strong> the <code>short description</code> field of the <a href="appendix.html#bitstreamformatregistry">Bitstream Format Registry</a>.</p>

<p>You can also implement more dynamic or configurable Media/Format Filters which extend <a href="business.html#selfnamedplugin"><code>SelfNamedPlugin</code></a>.  
More information is provide below in <a href="#newfilter">Creating a new Media/Format Filter</a></p>




  <h3><a name="general-email" id="general-email">Wording of E-mail Messages</a></h3>

  <p>Sometimes DSpace automatically sends e-mail messages to users, for example to inform them of a new workflow task, or as a subscription e-mail alert. 
     The wording of emails can be changed by editing the relevant file in <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/emails</code>. 
     Each file is commented. Be careful to keep the right number 'placeholders' (e.g.<code>{2}</code>).<br />
     <strong>Note:</strong> You should replace the contact-information "<code>dspace-help@myu.edu or call us at xxx-555-xxxx</code>" with your own contact details in:
     <ul>
     	<li><code>config/emails/change_password</code></li>
     	<li><code>config/emails/register</code></li>
     </ul>
     
  </p>
 
  <h2><a name="general-registries" id="general-registries">The Metadata and Bitstream Format Registries</a></h2>

  <p>
    The <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/registries</code> directory contains three XML files. 
    These are used to load the <em>initial</em> contents of the Metadata Schema Registry, 
    <a href="appendix.html#dublincoreregistry">Dublin Core Metadata registry</a> 
    and <a href="appendix.html#bitstreamformatregistry">Bitstream Format registry</a>. 
    After the initial loading (performed by <code>ant fresh_install</code> above), 
    the registries reside in the database; the XML files are not updated. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In order to change the registries, you may adjust the XML files before the first installation of DSpace. 
    On an allready running instance it is recommended to change bitstream registries via DSpace admin UI, but
    the metadata registries can be loaded again at any time from the XML files without difficult. 
    The changes made via admin UI are not reflected in the XML files.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Metadata Schema Registry</h3>
  
  <p>The default metadata schema in DSpace is Dublin Core, so it is distributed with a single entry in
  the source XML file for that namespace.  If you wish to add more schemas you can do this in one of two
  ways.  Via the DSpace admin UI you may define new Metadata Schemas, edit existing schemas and move 
  elements between schemas.  But you may also modify the XML file (or provide an additional one), and
  re-import the data as follows:</p>
  
  <pre>
  [dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.adminster.SchemaImporter -f [xml file]
  </pre>
  
  The XML file should be structured as follows:
  
  <pre>
	&lt;metadata-schemas&gt;
		&lt;schema&gt;
			&lt;name&gt;[schema name]&lt;/name&gt;
			&lt;namespace&gt;http://myu.edu/some/namespace&lt;/namespace&gt;
		&lt;/schema&gt;
	&lt;/metadata-schemas&gt;
  </pre>
  
  <h3>Metadata Format Registries</h3>
 	
  <p>
    The default metadata schema is Dublin Core, so DSpace is distributed with a default Dublin Core Metadata Registry. 
    Currently, the system requires that every item have a Dublin Core record.</p>
    <p>There is a set of Dublin Core Elements, which is used by the system and should not be removed or moved to another schema, 
    see <a href="appendix.html#dublincoreregistry">Appendix: Default Dublin Core Metadata registry</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: altering a Metadata Registry has no effect on corresponding parts, e.g. item submission interface, item display, 
    item import and vice versa. Every metadata element used in submission interface or item import must be registered before using it.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong> also that deleting a metadata element will delete all its corresponding values.
   </p>
 
   <p>If you wish to add more metadata elements, you can do this in one of two ways.  Via the DSpace admin UI you may define
   new metadata elements in the different available schemas.  But you may also modify the XML file (or provide an additional one),
   and re-import the data as follows:
   
   <pre>
  [dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.adminster.MetadataImporter -f [xml file]
  </pre>
 
 	The XML file should be structured as follows:
 	
 	<pre>
	&lt;dspace-dc-types&gt;
		&lt;dc-type&gt;
			&lt;schema&gt;dc&lt;/schema&gt;
			&lt;element&gt;contributor&lt;/element&gt;
			&lt;qualifier&gt;advisor&lt;/qualifier&gt;
			&lt;scope_note&gt;Use primarily for thesis advisor.&lt;/scope_note&gt;
		&lt;/dc-type&gt;
	&lt;/dspace-dc-types&gt;
 	</pre>
 
  <h3>Bitstream Format Registry</h3>
  <p>
    The bitstream formats recognized by the system and levels of support are similarly stored in the bitstream format registry. 
    This can also be edited at install-time via <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/registries/bitstream-formats.xml</code> or by the administation Web UI. 
    The contents of the bitstream format registry are entirely up to you, though the system requires that the following two formats are present:
    <ul>
      <li><code>Unknown</code></li>
      <li><code>License</code></li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Deleting a format will cause any existing bitstreams of this format to be reverted to the unknown bitstream format.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="general-license" id="general-license">The Default Submission License</a></h2>
  <p>For each submitted item, a license must be granted. The license will be stored along with the item in the bundle LICENSE in order to keep the information under which terms an items has been published.</p>
  <p>You may define a license for each collection seperately, when creating/editing a collection. If no collection specific license is defined, the default license is used.</p>
  <p>The default license  can be found in <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/default.license</code> and can be edited via the dspace-admin interface.</p>
  <p>DSpace comes with a demo license, which you must adopt to your institutional needs and the legal regulations of your country.</p>
  <p>If in doubt, contact the law department of your institution.</p>
  <h3>Possible Points in a License </h3>

   <h3><a name="xmlui-configure" id="xmlui-configure">Configuring Themes and Aspects</h3>

    <p>The Manakin user interface is composed of two distinct components: <i>aspects</i> and <i>themes</i>. Manakin aspects are like extensions or plugins for Manakin; they are interactive components that modify existing features or provide new features for the digital repository. Manakin themes stylize the look-and-feel of the repository, community, or collection.</p>

    <p>The repository administrator is able to define which aspects and themes are installed for the particular repository by editing the <code>[dspace]/config/xmlui.xconf</code> configuration file. The <code>xmlui.xconf</code> file consists of two major sections: Aspects and Themes. </p>

    <h4>Aspects</h4>

<p>The <code>&lt;aspects&gt;</code> section defines the "Aspect Chain", or the linear set of aspects that are installed in the repository. For each aspect that is installed in the repository, the aspect makes available new features to the interface. For example, if the "submission" aspect were to be commented out or removed from the <code>xmlui.xconf</code>, then users would not be able to submit new items into the repository (even the links and language prompting users to submit items are removed). Each <code>&lt;aspect&gt;</code> element has two attributes, <i>name</i> & <i>path</i>. The name is used to identify the Aspect, while the path determines the directory where the aspect's code is located. Here is the default aspect configuration:

<pre>
   &lt;aspects&gt;
     &lt;aspect name="Artifact Browser" path="resource://aspects/ArtifactBrowser/" /&gt;
     &lt;aspect name="Administration" path="resource://aspects/Administrative/" /&gt;
     &lt;aspect name="E-Person" path="resource://aspects/EPerson/" /&gt;
     &lt;aspect name="Submission and Workflow" path="resource://aspects/Submission/" /&gt;
   &lt;/aspects&gt;
</pre>

A standard distribution of Manakin/DSpace includes four "core" aspects:

<ul>
<li><b>Artifact Browser</b><br/>
The Artifact Browser Aspect is responsible for browsing communities, collections, items and bitstreams, viewing an individual item and searching the repository.</li>

<li><b>E-Person</b><br/>
The E-Person Aspect is responsible for logging in, logging out, registering new users, dealing with forgotten passwords, editing profiles and changing passwords.</li>

<li><b>Submission</b><br/>
The Submission Aspect is responsible for submitting new items to DSpace, determining the workflow process and ingesting the new items into the DSpace repository.</li>

<li><b>Administrative</b><br/>
The Administrative Aspect is responsible for administrating DSpace, such as creating, modifying and removing all communities, collections, e-persons, groups, registries and authorizations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Themes</h4>

<p>The <code>&lt;themes&gt;</code> section defines a set of "rules" that determine where themes are installed in the repository. Each rule is processed in the order that it appears, and the first rule that matches determines the theme that is applied (so order is important). Each rule consists of a <code>&lt;theme&gt;</code> element with several possible attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>name</b> (<i>always required</i>)<br/>

The name attribute is used to document the theme's name.</li>

<li><b>path</b> (<i>always required</i>)<br/>

The path attribute determines where the theme is located relative to the <code>themes/</code> directory and must either contain a trailing slash or point directly to the theme's <code>sitemap.xmap</code> file.</li>

<li><b>regex</b> (<i>either regex and/or handle is required</i>)<br/>

The regex attribute determines which URLs the theme should apply to. </li>

<li><b>handle</b> (<i>either regex and/or handle is required</i>)<br/>

The handle attribute determines which community, collection, or item the theme should apply to.<br/> 
</ul>

<p>If you use the "handle" attribute, the effect is cascading, meaning if a rule is established for a community then all collections and items within that community will also have this theme apply to them as well. Here is an example configuration:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;themes&gt;
    &lt;theme name="Theme 1" handle="123456789/23" path="theme1/"/&gt;
    &lt;theme name="Theme 2" regex="community-list" path="theme2/"/&gt;
    &lt;theme name="Reference Theme" regex=".*" path="Reference/"/&gt;
  &lt;/themes&gt;
</pre> 

<p>In the example above three themes are configured: "Theme 1", "Theme 2", and the "Reference Theme". The first rule specifies that "Theme 1" will apply to all communities, collections, or items that are contained under the parent community "123456789/23". The next rule specifies any URL containing the string "community-list" will get "Theme 2". The final rule, using the regular expression ".*", will match <b>anything</b>, so all pages which have not matched one of the preceding rules will be matched to the Reference Theme.</p>

<p>The XMLUI user interface supports multiple languages through the use of internationalization catalogues as defined by the <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/i18nTransformer.html">Cocoon Internationalization Transformer</a>. Each catalogue contains the translation of all user-displayed strings into a particular language or variant. Each catalogue is a single xml file whose name is based upon the language it is designated for, thus:</p>

messages_<i>language</i>_<i>country</i>_<i>variant</i>.xml<br/>
messages_<i>language</i>_<i>country</i>.xml<br/>
messages_<i>language</i>.xml<br/>
messages.xml<br/>

<p>The interface will automatically determine which file to select based upon the user's browser and system configuration. For example, if the user's browser is set to Australian English then first the system will check if <code>messages_en_au.xml</code> is available. If this translation is not available it will fall back to <code>messages_en.xml</code>, and finally if that is not available, <code>messages.xml</code>. </p>

<p>Manakin supplies an English only translation of the interface.  In order to add other translations to the system, locate the <code>[dspace-source]/dspace/modules/xmlui/src/main/webapp/i18n/</code> directory. By default this directory will be empty; to add additional translations add alternative versions of the <code>messages.xml</code> file in specific language and country variants as needed for your installation. </p>

To set a language other than English as the default language for the repository's interface, simply name the translation catalogue for the new default language "<code>messages.xml</code>"</p>

<h3><a name="xmlui-newtheme" id="xmlui-newtheme">Creating a New Theme</a></h3>

<p>Manakin themes stylize the look-and-feel of the repository, community, or collection and are distributed as self-contained packages. A Manakin/DSpace installation may have multiple themes installed and available to be used in different parts of the repository. The central component of a theme is the sitemap.xmap, which defines what resources are available to the theme such as XSL stylesheets, CSS stylesheets, images, or multimedia files.</p>

<b>1) Create theme skeleton</b>
<p>Most theme developers do not create a new theme from scratch; instead they start from the standard theme template, which defines a skeleton structure for a theme. The template is located at: <code>[dspace-source]/dspace-xmlui/dspace-xmlui-webbapp/src/main/webbapp/themes/template</code>. To start your new theme simply copy the theme template into your locally defined modules directory, <code>[dspace-source]/dspace/modules/xmlui/src/main/webbapp/themes/[your theme's directory]/</code>.</p>

<b>2) Modify theme variables</b>
<p>The next step is to modify the theme's parameters so that the theme knows where it is located. Open the <code>[your theme's directory]/sitemap.xmap</code> and look for <code>&lt;global-variables&gt;</code></p>

<pre>
   &lt;global-variables&gt;
      &lt;theme-path&gt;[your theme's directory]&lt;/theme-path&gt;
      &lt;theme-name&gt;[your theme's name]&lt;/theme-name&gt;
   &lt;/global-variables&gt;
</pre>

<p>Update both the theme's path to the directory name you created in step one. The theme's name is used only for documentation.</p>

<b>3) Add your CSS stylesheets</b>

<p>The base theme template will produce a repository interface without any style - just plain XHTML with no color or formatting. To make your theme useful you will need to supply a CSS Stylesheet that creates your desired look-and-feel. Add your new CSS stylesheets:<p>

<code>[your theme's directory]/lib/style.css</code>    (The base style sheet used for all browsers)<br/>
<code>[your theme's directory]/lib/style-ie.css</code>   (Specific stylesheet used for internet explorer)<br/>
<br/>

<b>4) Install theme and rebuild DSpace</b>
<p>Next rebuild & deploy DSpace as described in the <a href="install.html">installation portion of the manual</a>, and ensure the theme has been installed as described in the previous section "<a href="configure.html#xmlui-configure">Configuring Themes and Aspects</a>".</p>

  <h3><a name="jspui-controlledvocabulary" id="jspui-controlledvocabulary">Configuring Controlled Vocabularies</a></h3>
  <p>
  DSpace now supports controlled vocabularies to confine the set of keywords that users can use
  while describing items.
  </p>
  <p>
  The need for a limited set of keywords is important since it eliminates the
  ambiguity of a free description system, consequently simplifying the task of finding specific
  items of information.
  </p>
  <p>
  The controlled vocabulary add-on allows the user to choose from a defined set of keywords organised
  in an tree (taxonomy) and then use these keywords to describe items while they are being submitted.
  </p>
  <p>
  We have also developed a small search engine that displays the classification tree (or taxonomy)
  allowing the user to select the branches that best describe the information that he/she seeks.
  </p>
  <p>
  The taxonomies are described in XML following this (very simple) structure:
  </p>

<p><code>
&lt;node id="acmccs98" label="ACMCCS98"&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;  &lt;isComposedBy&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    &lt;node id="A." label="General Literature"&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&lt;isComposedBy&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  &lt;node id="A.0" label="GENERAL"/&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  &lt;node id="A.1" label="INTRODUCTORY AND SURVEY"/&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  ...<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&lt;/isComposedBy&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    &lt;/node&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;    ...<br/>
&nbsp;  &lt;/isComposedBy&gt;<br/>
&lt;/node&gt;<br/>
</code></p>
<p>
Your are free to use any application you want to create your controlled vocabularies. A simple
text editor should be enough for small projects. Bigger projects will require more complex
tools. You may use Proteg&eacute; to create your taxonomies, save them as OWL and then use a
XML Stylesheet (XSLT) to transform your documents to the appropriate format. Future enhancements
to this add-on should make it compatible with standard schemas such as OWL or RDF.
</p>
<p>
In order to make DSpace compatible with WAI 2.0, the add-on is <b>turned off</b> by default
(the add-on relies strongly on Javascript to function).
 It can be activated by setting the following property in <code>dspace.cfg</code>:
<p>
<code>
   webui.controlledvocabulary.enable = true
</code>
</p>
<p>
New vocabularies should be placed in <code><i>[dspace]/config/controlled-vocabularies/</i></code> and must be
according to the structure described. A validation XML Schema can be downloaded <a href="controlledvocabulary.xsd">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Vocabularies need to be associated with the correspondant DC metadata fields.
Edit the file <code><i>[dspace]/config/input-forms.xml</i></code> and place
a <code>"vocabulary"</code> tag under the <code>"field"</code> element that you
want to control. Set value of the <code>"vocabulary"</code> element to
the name of the file that contains the vocabulary, leaving out the extension
(the add-on will only load files with extension "*.xml").
For example:
</p>
<p>
<code>
       &lt;field&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dc-schema&gt;dc&lt;/dc-schema&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dc-element&gt;subject&lt;/dc-element&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dc-qualifier&gt;&lt;/dc-qualifier&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- An input-type of twobox MUST be marked as repeatable --&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;repeatable&gt;true&lt;/repeatable&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;label&gt;Subject Keywords&lt;/label&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input-type&gt;twobox&lt;/input-type&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;hint&gt; Enter appropriate subject keywords or phrases below. &lt;/hint&gt;<br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;required&gt;&lt;/required&gt;<br/>
         <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;vocabulary [closed="false"]&gt;nsi&lt;/vocabulary&gt;</b><br/>
       &lt;/field&gt;<br/>
</code>
</p>
<p>
The vocabulary element has an optional boolean attribute <b>closed</b> that can be used to force input only with 
the javascript of controlled-vocabulary add-on. 
The default behaviour (i.e. without this attribute) is as set <b>closed="false"</b>.
This allow the user also to enter the value in free way.
</p>
<p>
The following vocabularies are currently available by default:
</p>
<ul>
	<!-- <li><strong>acmccs98-1.2.4</strong> - <em>acmccs98-1.2.4.xml</em> - ACM Computing Classification System</li> -->
	<li><strong>nsi</strong> - <em>nsi.xml</em> - The Norwegian Science Index</li>
	<li><strong>srsc</strong> - <em>srsc.xml</em> - Swedish Research Subject Categories</li>
</ul>
   
<h3><a name="jspui-multilingual" id="multilingualui">Configuring Multilingual Support</a></h3>
  <h4>Setting the default language for the application</h4>
      The default language for the application is set via the <code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/config/dspace.cfg</code> parameter <code>default.locale</code>. <br />
      This is a locale according to i18n and might consist of country, country_language or country_language_variant, <br />
      e. g.: <code>default.locale=en</code>. If not default locale is specified the server locale will be used instead.
  <h4>Supporting more than one language</h4>
  <h5>Changes in dspace.cfg</h5>
      With the <code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/config/dspace.cfg</code> parameter <code>webui.supported.locales</code> you may provide a comma seperated list of supported (including the default locale) locales. <br />
      The locales might have the form country, country_language or country_language_variant, e. g.:<br />
     <code>webui.supported.locales = en, de</code> or <code>webui.supported.locales = en, en_ca, de</code>.<br />
     This will result in:
     <ul>
       <li>a language switch in the default header</li>
       <li>the user will able to choose his preferred language, this will be part of his profile</li>
       <li>wording of emails
         <ul>
    	   <li>mails to registered users e. g. alerting service will use the preferred language of the user</li>
           <li>mails to unregistered users e. g. suggest an item will use the language of the session</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
	<li>according to the language selected for the session, using dspace-admin Edit News will edit the news file of the language according to session</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Related files</h5>
        If you set webui.supported.locales make sure that all the related additional files for each language are available. <code>LOCALE</code> should correspond to the locale set in <code>webui.supported.locales</code>, 
        e. g.: for webui.supported.locales = en, de, fr, there should be:
    <ul>
      <li><code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/dspace/modules/jspui/src/main/resources/Messages.properties</code></li>

    </ul>
    
    
<h3><a name="jspui-jsp" id="jspui-jsp">Customizing the JSP pages</a></h3>

  <p>The JSPUI interface is implemented using Java Servlets which handle the business logic, and JavaServer Pages (JSPs) which produce the HTML pages sent to an end-user. Since the JSPs are much closer to HTML than Java code, altering the look and feel of DSpace is relatively easy.</p>

  <p>To make it even easier, DSpace allows you to 'override' the JSPs included in the source distribution with modified versions, that are stored in a separate place, so when it comes to updating your site with a new DSpace release, your modified versions will not be overwritten.  It should be possible to dramatically change the look of DSpace to suit your organization by just changing the CSS style file and the site 'skin' or 'layout' JSPs in <code>jsp/layout</code>; if possible, it is recommended you limit local customizations to these files to make future upgrades easier.</p>

  <p>You can also easily edit the text that appears on each JSP page by editing the dictionary file.  However, note that unless you change the entry in all of the different language message files, users of other languages will still see the default text for their language.  See <A HREF="application.html#i18n">internationalization</A>.</P>

  <p>Note that the data (attributes) passed from an underlying Servlet to the JSP may change between versions, so you may have to modify your customized JSP to deal with the new data.</p>

  <p>Thus, if possible, it is recommended you limit your changes to the 'layout' JSPs and the stylesheet.</P>

  <p>The JSPs are available in one of two places:
     <ul>
     <li><code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/dspace-jspui/dspace-jspui-webapp/src/main/webapp/</code> - Only exists if you downloaded the full Source Release of DSpace</li>
     <li><code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/dspace/target/dspace-[version].dir/webapps/dspace-jspui-webapp/</code> - The location where they are copied after first building DSpace.</li>
     </ul>
  </p>
  <p>If you wish to modify a particular JSP, place your edited version in the <code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/dspace/modules/jspui/src/main/webapp/</code> directory (<i>this is the replacement for the pre-1.5 <code>/jsp/local</code> directory</i>), with the same path as the original.  If they exist, these will be used in preference to the default JSPs. For example:</p>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>DSpace default</th>

        <th>Locally-modified version</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code><i>[jsp.dir]</i>/community-list.jsp</code></td>

        <td><code><i>[jsp.custom-dir]</i>/dspace/modules/jspui/src/main/webapp/community-list.jsp</code></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code><i>[jsp.dir]</i>/mydspace/main.jsp</code></td>

        <td><code><i>[jsp.custom-dir]</i>/dspace/modules/jspui/src/main/webapp/mydspace/main.jsp</code></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Heavy use is made of a style sheet, <code>styles.css.jsp</code>. If you make edits, copy the local version to <code><i>[jsp.custom-dir]</i>/dspace/modules/jspui/src/main/webapp/styles.css.jsp</code>, and it will be used automatically in preference to the default, as described above.</p>

  <p>Fonts and colors can be easily changed using the stylesheet. The stylesheet is a JSP so that the user's browser version can be detected and the stylesheet tweaked accordingly.</p>

  <p>The 'layout' of each page, that is, the top and bottom banners and the navigation bar, are determined by the JSPs <code>/layout/header-*.jsp</code> and <code>/layout/footer-*.jsp</code>. You can provide modified versions of these (in <code><i>[jsp.custom-dir]</i>/dspace/modules/jspui/src/main/webapp/layout</code>), or define more styles and apply them to pages by using the "style" attribute of the <code>dspace:layout</code> tag.</p>

  <p>After you've customized your JSPs, <strong>you must rebuild the DSpace Web application</strong>. If you haven't already built and installed it, follow the <a href="install.html">install</a> directions. Otherwise, follow the steps below:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Rebuild the DSpace installation package by running the following command from your <code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/dspace/</code> directory:</p>
      <pre>mvn package</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Re-install the DSpace WAR(s) to <code><i>[dspace]</i>/webapps</code> by running the following command from your <code><i>[dspace-source]</i>/dspace/target/dspace-[version].dir</code> directory:</p>
      <pre>
ant -Dconfig=<i>[dspace-source]</i>/config/dspace.cfg update
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Depending on your setup with Tomcat, you may also need to do the following:
      <ul>
      <li>Shut down Tomcat, and delete any existing <i>[tomcat]</i>/webapps/dspace directories.</li>
   	  <li>Copy the new .war file(s) to the Tomcat webapps directory:</li>
   	  <li>Restart Tomcat.</li>
   	  </ul>
   	  </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>When you restart the web server you should see your customized JSPs.</p>

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <h2><a name="advanced" id="advanced">Advanced DSpace Customizations</a></h2>
   
   <p> Some customizations to the DSpace platform require advanced skills or knowlege to complete. The options list here will require either knowlege in system administration or may involve light programming.</p>
   
   
   <h3><a name="checksum" id="checksum">Checksum Checker</a></h3>
  <p>There are three aspects of the Checksum Checker's operation that can be configured:<p>
<ol>
	<li>the execution mode</li>
  	<li>the logging output</li>
  	<li>the policy for removing old checksum results from the database</li>
	
</ol>
  
  <h4>Checker Execution Mode</h4>
  
  <p>Execution mode can be configured using command line options. Information on the options can be found at any time by running <code><i>[dspace]</i>/bin/checker --help</code>. The different modes are described below; see the "Which to use" section that follows for details on the various pros and cons.</p>

<p>Unless a particular bitstream or handle is specified, the Checksum Checker will always check bitstreams in order of the least recently checked bitstream. (Note that this means that the most recently ingested bitstreams will be the last ones checked by the Checksum Checker.)</p>

  <strong>Limited Count Mode</strong>
  
  <p>To check a specific number of bitstreams, use the -c option followed by an integer number of bitstreams to check:</p>

  <pre>bin/checker -c 10</pre>
				

  <p>Limited count mode is particularly useful for checking that the checker is executing properly. The Checksum Checker's default execution mode is to check a single bitstream, as if the -c 1 option had been given.</p>

  <strong>Limited Duration Mode</strong>
	
  <p>To run the Checker for a specific period of time, use the -d option with a time argument:</p>

  <pre>bin/checker -d 10m
bin/checker -d 2h</pre>

<p>Valid options for specifying duration are <code>s</code> for seconds, <code>m</code> for minutes, <code>h</code> for hours, <code>d</code> for days, <code>w</code> for weeks, and <code>y</code> for years (OK, so we're optimists).</p>

  <p>The checker will keep starting new bitstream checks for the specified duration, so actual execution duration will be slightly longer than the specified duration. Bear this in mind when scheduling checks.</p>

  <strong>Check Specific Bitstreams</strong>

  <p>To check one or more particular bitstreams by ID, use the -b option followed by one or more bitstream IDs:</p>

  <pre>bin/checker -b 1 2 3 4</pre>
				
  <p>This mode is useful when analyzing problems reported in the logs and when verifying that a resolution has been successful.</p>
  
  <strong>Check Specific Handles</strong>

  <p>Use the -a option followed by a handle:</p>

  <pre>bin/checker -a 123456/123</pre>	
  
  <p>This will check all the bitstreams inside an item, collection or community.</p>
				
				
  <strong>Continuous Looping</strong>

  <p>There are two looping modes:</p>

<pre>bin/checker -l     # Loops once through the repository  
bin/checker -L	    # Loops continuously through the repository</pre>
				
  <p>The -l option can be used if your repository is relatively small and your backup strategy requires it to be completely validated at a particular point. The -L option might be useful if you have a large repository, and you don't mind (or can avoid) the IO load caused by the checker.</p>

<strong>Which to Use</strong>

  <p>The Checksum Checker was designed with the idea that most sys admins will run it from the cron. For small repositories we recommend using the -l option in the cron. For larger repositories that cannot be completely checked in a couple of hours, we recommend the -d option in the cron.</p>  
  
  <h4>Checker Reporting</h4>
  
  <p>Checksum Checker uses log4j to report its results. By default it will report to a log called <code><i>[dspace]</i>/log/checker.log</code>, and it will report only on bitstreams for which the newly calculated checksum does not match the stored checksum. To report on all bitstreams checked regardless of outcome, use the <code>-v</code> (verbose) command line option:</p> 
  
  <pre>bin/checker -l -v    #Loop through the repository once and
  report in detail about every bitstream checked.</pre> 

<p>To change the location of the log, or to modify the prefix used on each line of output, edit the <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/templates/log4j.properties</code> file and run <code><i>[dspace]</i>/bin/install_configs</code>. </p>			
  
  
  <h4>Checker Results Pruning</h4>
  
  <p>The Checksum Checker will store the result of every check in the checksum_history table. By default, successful checksum matches that are eight weeks old or older will be deleted when the -p command line option is used (unsuccessful ones will be retained indefinitely). The amount of time for which results are retained in the checksum_history table can be modified by one of two methods: </p>

<ol>
<li>editing the retention policies in <code><i>[dspace]/</i>config/dspace.cfg</code> OR
</li>
<li>passing in a properties file containing retention policies when using the -p option. </li>
</ol>

  <p>Pruning is controlled by a number of properties, each of which describes a checksum result code, and the length of time for which results with that code should be retained. The format is <code>checker.retention.[RESULT CODE]=[duration]</code>. For example: -</p>
  
  <pre>checker.retention.CHECKSUM_MATCH=8w</pre>
  
  <p>indicates that successful checksum matches will be retained for eight weeks. Supported units of time are</p>
  
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>Seconds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m</td>
      <td>Minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>Hours</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>Days</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>w</td>
      <td>Weeks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>y</td>
      <td>Years</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  
  <p>(Note that these units are also used for describing durations for the <code>-d</code> limited duration mode.)</p>
  
  <p>There is a special property, <code>checker.retention.default</code>, that is used to assign a default retention period.</p>
  
  <p>To execute the pruning you must use the -p command line option (with or without a properties file). Checksum Checker will prune the history table before beginning new checks. We recommend that you use this option regularly, as the checksum_history table can grow very large without it.</p>
   
   
   <h3><a name="authentication" id="authentication">Custom Authentication</a></h3>

  <p>Since many institutions and organizations have exisiting
     authentication systems, DSpace has been designed to allow these to
     be easily integrated into an existing authentication infrastructure.
     It keeps a series, or "stack", of <em>authentication methods</em>, so
     each one can be tried in turn.  This makes it easy to add new
     authentication methods or rearrange the order without changing any
     existing code.  You can also share authentication code with other sites.</p>

  <p>The configuration property
     <code>plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod</code>
     defines the authentication stack.  It is a comma-separated list of
     class names.  Each of these classes implements a different
     <em>authentication method</em>, or way of determining the identity of
     the user.  They are invoked in the order specified until one succeeds.

  <p>An authentication method is a class that implements the
     interface <code>org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod</code>.
     It <em>authenticates</em> a user by evaluating the <em>credentials</em>
     (e.g. username and password) he or she presents and
     checking that they are valid.</p>

  <p>The basic authentication procedure in the DSpace Web UI is this:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A request is received from an end-user's browser that, if fulfilled, would lead to an action requiring authorization taking place.</li>

    <li>If the end-user is already authenticated:

      <ul>
        <li>If the end-user is allowed to perform the action, the action proceeds</li>

        <li>If the end-user is NOT allowed to perform the action, an authorization error is displayed.</li>

       <li>If the end-user is NOT authenticated, i.e. is accessing DSpace anonymously:</li>
     </ul>

    <li>The parameters etc. of the request are stored</li>

    <li>The Web UI's <code>startAuthentication</code> method is invoked.</li>

    <li>First it tries all the authentication methods which do <em>implicit</em>
        authentication (i.e. they work with just the information already
        in the Web request, such as an X.509 client certificate).  If one
        of these succeeds, it proceeds from Step 2 above.</li>

    <li>If none of the implicit methods succeed, the UI responds by putting
        up a "login" page to collect credentials for one of the
        <em>explicit</em> authentication methods in the stack.  The servlet
        processing that page then
        gives the proffered credentials to each authentication method in turn
        until one succeeds, at which point it
        retries the original operation from Step 2 above.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please see the source files <code>AuthenticationManager.java</code> and <code>AuthenticationMethod.java</code> for more details about this mechanism.

  <h4>Authentication by Password</h4>

  <p>The default method <code>org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication</code> has the following properties:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Use of inbuilt e-mail address/password-based log-in. This is achieved by forwarding a request that is attempting an action requiring authorization to the password log-in servlet, <code>/password-login</code>. The password log-in servlet (<code>org.dspace.app.webui.servlet.PasswordServlet</code> contains code that will resume the original request if authentication is successful, as per step 3. described above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Users can register themselves (i.e. add themselves as e-people without needing approval from the administrators), and can set their own passwords when they do this</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Users are not members of any special (dynamic) e-person groups</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p>You can restrict the domains from which new users are able to regiser. To enable this feature, uncomment the following line from dspace.cfg: <code>authentication.password.domain.valid = example.com</code> Example options might be '<code>@example.com</code>' to restrict registration to users with addresses ending in @example.com, or '<code>@example.com, .ac.uk</code>' to restrict registration to users with addresses ending in @example.com or with addresses in the .ac.uk domain.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

 <h4>X.509 Certificate Authentication</h4>

  <p>The X.509 authentication method uses an X.509 certificate sent by
  the client to establish his/her identity.  It requires the client to
  have a personal Web certificate installed on their browser (or other client
  software) which is issued by a Certifying Authority (CA) recognized
  by the web server.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>See the <a href="install.html#https">HTTPS installation
  instructions</a> to configure your Web server.  If you are using
  HTTPS with Tomcat, note that the <code>&lt;Connector&gt;</code> tag
  <em>must</em> include the attribute <code><b>clientAuth="true"</b></code>
  so the server requests a personal Web certificate from the client.</p>
  </li>
  <p><li>
  Add the <code>org.dspace.authenticate.X509Authentication</code> plugin
  <em>first</em> to the list of stackable authentication methods in the value
  of the configuration key <code>plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod</code>
  <i>E.g.:</i>
  </p>
  <pre>
    plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = \
        org.dspace.authenticate.X509Authentication, \
        org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication
  </pre>

  </li>
  <p><li>
  You must also configure DSpace with the same CA certificates as the
  web server, so it can accept and interpret the clients' certificates.
  It can share the same keystore file as the web server, or a
  separate one, or a CA certificate in a file by itself.
  Configure it by <em>one</em> of these methods, either the Java keystore

 <pre>
  authentication.x509.keystore.path = <em>path to Java keystore file</em>
  authentication.x509.keystore.password = <em>password to access the keystore</em>
 </pre>

 ...or the separate CA certificate file (in PEM or DER format):
 <pre>
  authentication.x509.ca.cert = <em>path to certificate file for CA whose client certs to accept.</em>
 </pre>
  </p>
  </li>
  <p><li>
  <p>Choose whether to enable auto-registration:  If you want users who
  authenticate successfully to be automatically registered as new E-Persons
  if they are not already, set the
  <code>authentication.x509.autoregister</code> configuration property
  to <code>true</code>.
  This lets you automatically accept all users with valid
  personal certificates.  The default is <code>false</code>.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Example of a Custom Authentication Method</h4>

  <p>Also included in the source is an implementation of an authentication method used at MIT, <code>edu.mit.dspace.MITSpecialGroup</code>.
     This does not actually authenticate a user, it <em>only</em>
     adds the current user to a special (dynamic) group called 'MIT
     Users' (which must be present in the system!).  This allows us to
     create authorization policies for MIT users without having to
     manually maintain membership of the MIT users group.</p>

  <p>By keeping this code in a separate method, we can customize the
     authentication process for MIT by simply adding it to the stack in
     the DSpace configuration.  None of the code has to be touched.

  <p>You can create your own custom authentication method and add it to
     the stack.  Use the most similar existing method as a model, e.g.
     <code>org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication</code> for an "explicit"
     method (with credentials entered interactively) or
     <code>org.dspace.authenticate.X509Authentication</code> for an implicit
     method.</p>

  <h4><a name="ipauthentication" id="ipauthentication">Configuring IP Authentication</a></h4>
  
  <p>You can enable IP authentication by adding its method to the stack in the DSpace configuration, e.g.:</p>
  <pre>plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.IPAuthentication</pre>
  <p>You are than able to map DSpace groups to IP's in dspace.cfg by setting authentication.ip.GROUPNAME = iprange[, iprange ...], e.g:</p>
  <pre>
  authentication.ip.MY_UNIVERSITY = 10.1.2.3, \            # Full IP
                                    13.5, \                # Partial IP
                                    11.3.4.5/24, \         # with CIDR
                                    12.7.8.9/255.255.128.0 # with netmask
  </pre>
  <p><strong>Note: </strong>if the Groupname contains blanks you must escape the, e.g. Department\ of\ Statistics</p>

  <h4><a name="ldap" id="ldap">Configuring LDAP Authentication</a></h4>

  <p>You can enable LDAP authentication by adding its method to the
     stack in the DSpace configuration, e.g.</p>
     <pre>plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.LDAPAuthentication</pre>

  <p>If LDAP is enabled in the dspace.cfg file, then new users will be able to register by entering their username and password without being sent the registration token. If users do not have a username and password, then they can still register and login with just their email address the same way they do now.</p>

  <p>If you want to give any special privileges to LDAP users, create a stackable authentication method to automatically put people who have a netid into a special group. You might also want to give certain email addresses special privileges. Refer to the <a href="#authenticate">Custom Authentication Code</a> section above for more information about how to do this.</p>

  <p>Here is an explanation of what each of the different configuration parameters are for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>ldap.enable</b><br>
    This setting will enable or disable LDAP authentication in DSpace. With the setting off, users will be required to register and login with their email address. With this setting on, users will be able to login and register with their LDAP user ids and passwords.</li>

    <li><b>webui.ldap.autoregister</b><br>
    This will turn LDAP autoregistration on or off. With this on, a new EPerson object will be created for any user who successfully authenticates against the LDAP server when they first login. With this setting off, the user must first register to get an EPerson object by entering their LDAP username and password and filling out the forms.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.provider_url = ldap://ldap.myu.edu/o=myu.edu</b><br>
    This is the url to your institution's LDAP server. You may or may not need the /o=myu.edu part at the end. Your server may also require the ldaps:// protocol.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.id_field = uid</b><br>
    This is the unique identifier field in the LDAP directory where the username is stored.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.object_context = ou=people,o=myu.edu</b><br>
    This is the object context used when authenticating the user. It is appended to the ldap.id_field and username. For example uid=username,ou=people,o=myu.edu. You will need to modify this to match your LDAP configuration.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.search_context = ou=people</b><br>
    This is the search context used when looking up a user's LDAP object to retrieve their data for autoregistering. With ldap.autoregister turned on, when a user authenticates without an EPerson object we search the LDAP directory to get their name and email address so that we can create one for them. So after we have authenticated against uid=username,ou=people,o=byu.edu we now search in ou=people for filtering on [uid=username]. Often the ldap.search_context is the same as the ldap.object_context parameter. But again this depends on your LDAP server configuration.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.email_field = mail</b><br>
    This is the LDAP object field where the user's email address is stored. "mail" is the default and the most common for ldap servers. If the mail field is not found the username will be used as the email address when creating the eperson object.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.surname_field = sn</b><br>
    This is the LDAP object field where the user's last name is stored. "sn" is the default and is the most common for LDAP servers. If the field is not found the field will be left blank in the new eperson object.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.givenname_field = givenName</b><br>
    This is the LDAP object field where the user's given names are stored. I'm not sure how common the givenName field is in different LDAP instances. If the field is not found the field will be left blank in the new eperson object.</li>

    <li><b>ldap.phone_field = telephoneNumber</b><br>
    This is the field where the user's phone number is stored in the LDAP directory. If the field is not found the field will be left blank in the new eperson object.</li>
  </ul>
   
   
<h3><a name="statistics" id="statistics">Configuring System Statistical Reports</a></h3>

  <p>Statistics for the system can be made available at <code>http://www.mydspaceinstance.edu/statistics</code>. To use the system statistics you will have to initialise them as per the installation documentation, but before you do so you need to perform the customisations discussed here in order to ensure that the reports are generated correctly.</p>

  <h4>Configuration File</h4>

  <p>Configuration for the statistics system are in <code>[dspace]/config/dstat.cfg</code> and the file should guide you to correctly filling in the details required. For the most part you will not need to change this file. You may wish to edit <code>start.year</code> and <code>start.month</code> to customize the start date of the statistics.</p>

  <h4>Generating the statistics</h4>

  <p>The following scripts must be run (in this order) generate the statistcis:</p>
  <pre>
stat-initial
stat-general
stat-monthly
stat-report-initial
stat-report-general
stat-report-monthly
</pre>

  <p>Scripts eding with <code>-general</code> do the work for building reports spanning the entire history of the archive; scripts ending <code>-initial</code> are to initialise the reports by doing monthly reports from some start date up to the present; scripts ending <code>-monthly</code> generate a single monthly report <em>for the current month</em>.</p>

  <p><code>stat-inital</code> and <code>stat-report-inital</code> must be run to generate the first set of statistics. Following that, <code>stat-monthly</code>, <code>stat-general</code>, <code>stat-report-monthly</code> and <code>stat-report-general</code> should be run daily to update the statistics reports.</p>

  <p>If you want additional customisations, you can find additional information about the scripts by running:</p>
  <pre>[dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.app.statistics.LogAnalyser -help
[dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.app.statistics.ReportGenerator -help</pre>

 
   
  <h3><a name="oai" id="crosswalks">Activating Additional OAI-PMH Crosswalks</a></h3>

  <p>DSpace comes with an unqualified DC Crosswalk used in the default OAI-PMH data provider. There are also other Crosswalks bundled with the DSpace distribution which can be activated by editing one or more configuration files. How to do this for each available Crosswalk is described below. The DSpace source includes the following crosswalk plugins available for use with OAI-PMH:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><b><code>mets</code></b> - The manifest document from a DSpace METS SIP.</li>
    <li><b><code>mods</code></b> - MODS metadata, produced by the <a href="#mods">table-driven MODS dissemination crosswalk</a>.</li>
    <li><b><code>qdc</code></b> - Qualfied Dublin Core, produced by the <a href="#qdc">configurable QDC crosswalk</a>.
        Note that this QDC does <em>not</em> include all of the DSpace "dublin core" metadata fields, since the XML standard for QDC is defined for a different set of elements and qualifiers.</li>
   </ul>

 <p>OAI-PMH crosswalks based on Crosswalk Plugins are activated as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ensure the crosswalk plugin has a <em>lower-case</em> name (possibly
in addition to its upper-case name) in the plugin configuration.</li>
    <li>Add a line to the file <code>config/templates/oaicat.properties</code> of
the form:<br>
<code>Crosswalks.</code><i>plugin_name</i><code>=org.dspace.app.oai.PluginCrosswalk</code><br>
    substituting the plugin's name, e.g. <code>"mets"</code> or <code>"qdc"</code>for <i>plugin_name</i>.</li>
    <li>Run the <code>bin/install-configs</code> script</li>
    <li>Restart your servlet container, e.g. Tomcat, for the change to take effect.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>DIDL</h4>
  <p>By activating the DIDL provider, DSpace items are represented as MPEG-21 DIDL objects. These DIDL objects are XML documents that wrap both the Dublin Core metadata that describes the DSpace item and its actual bitstreams. A bitstream is provided inline in the DIDL object in a base64 encoded manner, and/or by means of a pointer to the bitstream. The data provider exposes DIDL objects via the metadataPrefix didl.</p>
  <p>The crosswalk does not deal with special characters and purposely skips dissemination of the <code>license.txt</code> file awaiting a better understanding on how to map DSpace rights information to MPEG21-DIDL.</p>

  <p>The DIDL Crosswalk can be activated as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Uncomment the <code>oai.didl.maxresponse</code> item in <code>dspace.cfg</code></li>
		<li>Uncomment the DIDL Crosswalk entry from the <code>config/templates/oaicat.properties</code> file</li>
		<li>Run	the <code>bin/install-configs</code> script</li>
		<li>Restart Tomcat</li>
		<li>Verify the Crosswalk is activated by accessing a URL such as <code>http://mydspace/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&amp;metadataPrefix=didl</code></li>
	</ul>
  
   <h3><a name="packager">Configuring Packager Plugins</a></h3>

<p>Package ingester plugins are configured as <a href="business.html#plugin">named or self-named plugins</a>

<p>You can add names for the existing plugins, and add new plugins, by altering these configuration properties.  See the <a href="business.html#plugin">Plugin Manager</a> architecture for more information about plugins.</p>

<h3><a name="crosswalk">Configuring Crosswalk Plugins</a></h3>
<p>Ingestion crosswalk plugins are configured as <a href="business.html#plugin">named or self-named plugins</a>
for the interface <code>org.dspace.content.crosswalk.IngestionCrosswalk</code>.
Dissemination crosswalk plugins are configured as <a href="business.html#plugin">named or self-named plugins</a>
for the interface <code>org.dspace.content.crosswalk.DisseminationCrosswalk</code>.</p>

<p>You can add names for existing crosswalks, add new plugin classes, and add new configurations for the configurable crosswalks as noted below.</p>

<h4><a name="mods">Configurable MODS dissemination crosswalk</a></h4>

<p>The MODS crosswalk is a self-named plugin.  To configure an instance of
the MODS crosswalk, add a property to the DSpace configuration starting
with <code>"crosswalk.mods.properties."</code>; the final word of the
property name becomes the plugin's name.  For example, a property name
<code>crosswalk.mods.properties.MODS</code> defines a crosswalk plugin
named <code>"MODS"</code>.</p>

<p> The value of this property is a path to a separate properties file
containing the configuration for this crosswalk.  The pathname is relative to the DSpace configuration directory, i.e. the <code>config</code> subdirectory of the DSpace install directory.
So, a line like:<pre> crosswalk.mods.properties.MODS = crosswalks/mods.properties</pre>
defines a crosswalk named <code>MODS</code> whose configuration comes from
the file <code>[dspace]/config/crosswalks/mods.properties</code>.</p>

<p>The MODS crosswalk properties file is a list of properties describing how DSpace metadata elements are to be turned into elements of the MODS XML output document.  The property name is a concatenation of the metadata schema, element name, and optionally the qualifier.  For example, the <code>contributor.author</code> element
in the native Dublin Core schema would be: <code>dc.contributor.author</code>. The value of the property is a line containing two segments separated by the vertical bar (<code>"|"</code>): The first part is an XML fragment
which is copied into the output document.  The second is an XPath expression describing where in that fragment to put the value of the metadata element.  For example, in this property:
<pre>
dc.contributor.author = &lt;mods:name&gt;&lt;mods:role&gt;&lt;mods:roleTerm type="text"&gt;author&lt;/mods:roleTerm&gt;&lt;/mods:role&gt;&lt;mods:namePart&gt;%s&lt;/mods:namePart&gt;&lt;/mods:name&gt; | mods:namePart/text()
</pre>
Some of the examples include the string <code>"%s"</code> in the prototype
XML where the text value is to be inserted, but don't pay any attention to
it, it is an artifact that the crosswalk ignores.

<p>For example, given an author named <em>Jack Florey</em>, the crosswalk will insert</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;mods:name&gt;
  &lt;mods:role&gt;
    &lt;mods:roleTerm type="text"&gt;author&lt;/mods:roleTerm&gt;
  &lt;/mods:role&gt;
  &lt;mods:namePart&gt;</code><em>Jack Florey</em><code>&lt;/mods:namePart&gt;
&lt;/mods:name&gt; </code></pre>
into the output document.  Read the example configuration file for more
details.

<h4><a name="qdc">Configurable Qualified Dublin Core (QDC) dissemination  crosswalk</a></h4>

<p>The QDC crosswalk is a self-named plugin.  To configure an instance of
the QDC crosswalk, add a property to the DSpace configuration starting
with <code>"crosswalk.qdc.properties."</code>; the final word of the
property name becomes the plugin's name.  For example, a property name
<code>crosswalk.qdc.properties.QDC</code> defines a crosswalk plugin
named <code>"QDC"</code>.</p>

<p>The value of this property is a path to a separate properties file
containing the configuration for this crosswalk.  The pathname is relative to the DSpace configuration directory, i.e. the <code>config</code> subdirectory of the DSpace install directory. So, a line like:<pre>  crosswalk.qdc.properties.QDC = crosswalks/qdc.properties</pre> defines a crosswalk named <code>QDC</code> whose configuration comes from the file <code>[dspace]/config/crosswalks/qdc.properties</code>.</p>

<p>You'll also need to configure the namespaces and schema location strings for the XML output generated by this crosswalk.  The namespaces property names are of the format: <br>
<code>crosswalk.qdc.namespace.</code><em>prefix</em> = <em>uri</em>
<br>where <em>prefix</em> is the namespace prefix and <em>uri</em> is the namespace URI.</p>

<p>For example, this shows how a crosswalk named "QDC" would be configured:
<pre>crosswalk.qdc.properties.QDC = crosswalks/QDC.properties
crosswalk.qdc.namespace.QDC.dc = http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
crosswalk.qdc.namespace.QDC.dcterms = http://purl.org/dc/terms/
crosswalk.qdc.schemaLocation.QDC  = \
  http://purl.org/dc/terms/ http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04/02/qualifieddc.xsd</pre></p>

<p>The QDC crosswalk properties file is a list of properties
describing how DSpace metadata elements are to be turned into elements of the Qualified DC XML output document.  The property name is a concatenation of the metadata schema, element name, and optionally
the qualifier.  For example, the <code>contributor.author</code> element in the native Dublin Core schema would be: <code>dc.contributor.author</code>. The value of the property is an XML fragment, the element whose value
will be set to the value of the metadata field in the property key.</p>

<p> For example, in this property:
<pre>  dc.coverage.temporal = &lt;dcterms:temporal /&gt;</pre>
the generated XML in the output document would look like, e.g.:
<pre>  &lt;dcterms:temporal&gt;Fall, 2005&lt;/dcterms:temporal&gt;</pre></p>

<h4>XSLT-based crosswalks</h4>

<p>The XSLT crosswalks use XSL stylesheet transformation (XSLT) to
 transform an XML-based external metadata format to or from DSpace's
 internal metadata.  XSLT crosswalks are much more powerful and
 flexible than the configurable MODS and QDC crosswalks, but they
 demand some esoteric knowledge (XSL stylesheets).  Given that, you can
 create all the crosswalks you need just by adding stylesheets and
 configuration lines, without touching any of the Java code.</p>
<p>A submission crosswalk is described by a configuration key starting with '<code>crosswalk.submission.</code>", like <pre>  crosswalk.submission.<i>PluginName</i>.stylesheet = <i>path</i></pre>
 The <em>PluginName</em> is, of course, the plugin's name.  The <em>path</em> value is the path to the file containing the crosswalk stylesheet (relative to <code><em>dspace.dir</em>/config</code>).</p>
<p>Here is an example that configures a crosswalk named "LOM" using a stylesheet
 in <code>[dspace]/config/crosswalks/d-lom.xsl</code>:
 <pre>  crosswalk.submission.stylesheet.LOM = crosswalks/d-lom.xsl</pre></p>

<p>A dissemination crosswalk is described by a configuration key starting with '<code>crosswalk.dissemination.</code>", like <pre>  crosswalk.dissemination.<i>PluginName</i>.stylesheet = <i>path</i></pre>
 The <em>PluginName</em> is, of course, the plugin's name. The <em>path</em> value is the path to the file containing
 the crosswalk stylesheet (relative to <code><em>dspace.dir</em>/config</code>).</p>

<p>You can make two different plugin names point to the same crosswalk,
 by adding two configuration entries with the same path, e.g.
 <pre>
    crosswalk.submission.MyFormat.stylesheet = crosswalks/myformat.xslt
    crosswalk.submission.almost_DC.stylesheet = crosswalks/myformat.xslt
 </pre></p>

<p>The dissemination crosswalk must also be configured with an XML Namespace
 (including prefix and URI) and an XML Schema for its output format.  This
 is configured on additional properties in the DSpace Configuration, i.e.:
 <pre>   crosswalk.dissemination.<i>PluginName</i>.namespace.<i>Prefix</i> = <i>namespace-URI</i>
   crosswalk.dissemination.<i>PluginName</i>.schemaLocation = <i>schemaLocation value</i> </pre>
 For example:
 <pre>   crosswalk.dissemination.qdc.namespace.dc = http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
   crosswalk.dissemination.qdc.namespace.dcterms = http://purl.org/dc/terms/
   crosswalk.dissemination.qdc.schemaLocation = \
      http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04/02/qualifieddc.xsd </pre></p>

<h4>DSpace Intermediate Metadata (DIM) format</h4>
 XSLT crosswalk plugins translate between the external metadata format
 and an XML format called <em>DSpace Intermediate Metadata</em>,
 which exists <em>only</em> for the purpose of XSLT crosswalks.
 It is <em>never</em> to be exported from DSpace, since it is not an
 acknowledged metadata format, it is simply an expression of the way
 DSpace stores its metadata fields internally.
 <p>All the elements in a DIM document are in the namespace
 <code>http://www.dspace.org/xmlns/dspace/dim</code>.</p>
 <p>The root element is named <code>dim</code>.  It has zero or more
 children, all <code>field</code> elements.  It may have an
 attribute <code>dspaceType</code>, which identifies the type of
 object ("ITEM", "COLLECTION", or "COMMUNITY") this metadata describes.  This attribute
 is only guaranteed to be set for dissemination crosswalks.</p>
 <p>Each <code>field</code> element may have the following attributes:
 <ul>
   <li><code>mdschema</code> (Required) The metadata schema, e.g. <code>"dc"</code>.</li>
   <li><code>element</code> (Required) Element name, such as "contributor".</li>
   <li><code>qualifier</code> Qualifier name, such as "author".</li>
   <li><code>lang</code> Language code describing language of this entry.</li>
 </ul>
 The value of <code>field</code> is the value of that metadata field.
 Fields with the same qualifiers may be repeated.

<p>Here is an example of the DIM format:
<pre>    &lt;dim:dim xmlns:dim="http://www.dspace.org/xmlns/dspace/dim" dspaceType="ITEM"&gt;
      &lt;dim:field mdschema="dc" element="title" lang="en_US"&gt;
        The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimonline
      &lt;/dim:field&gt;
      &lt;dim:field mdschema="dc" element="contributor" qualifier="author"&gt;
        Isaac Asimov
      &lt;/dim:field&gt;
      &lt;dim:field mdschema="dc" element="language" qualifier="iso"&gt;
        eng
      &lt;/dim:field&gt;
      &lt;dim:field mdschema="dc" element="subject" qualifier="other" lang="en_US"&gt;
        time-travel scifi hoax
      &lt;/dim:field&gt;
      &lt;dim:field element="publisher"&gt;
        Boston University Department of Biochemistry
      &lt;/dim:field&gt;
    &lt;/dim:dim&gt;
</pre></p>

<h4>Testing XSLT Crosswalks</h4>
 The XSLT crosswalks will automatically reload an XSL stylesheet that
 has been modified, so you can edit and test
 stylesheets without restarting DSpace.

 <p>You can test a dissemination crosswalk by hooking it up to an OAI-PMH
 crosswalk and using an OAI request to get the metadata for a known item.</p>

 <p>Testing the submission crosswalk is more difficult, so we have supplied
 a command-line utility to help.  It calls the crosswalk plugin to
 translate an XML document you submit, and displays the resulting
 intermediate XML (DIM).  Invoke it with:
 <pre><em>[dspace]</em>/bin/dsrun org.dspace.content.crosswalk.XSLTIngestionCrosswalk [-l] <em>plugin input-file</em></pre>
 ..where <em>plugin</em> is the name of the crosswalk plugin to test (e.g.
  "LOM"), and <em>input-file</em> is a file containing an XML document
  of metadata in the appropriate format.</p>
  <p> Add the <code>-l</code> option to to pass the ingestion crosswalk a list of elements instead of a whole document, as if the List form of the ingest() method had been called. This is needed to test ingesters for formats like DC that get called with lists of elements instead of a root element.</p>
   
 
   <h3><a name="mediafilters">Creating a new Media/Format Filter</a></h3>

    <h4>Creating a simple Media Filter</h4>
    <p>New Media Filters <strong>must implement</strong> the <code>org.dspace.app.mediafilter.FormatFilter</code> interface.  More information on the methods you need to implement is provided in the <code>FormatFilter.java</code> source file.  For example:
    <code><pre>
	public class MySimpleMediaFilter implements FormatFilter</pre></code>
    </p>  
	
	<p>Alternatively, you could extend the <code>org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MediaFilter</code> class, which just defaults to performing no pre/post-processing of bitstreams before or after filtering.
	<code><pre>
	public class MySimpleMediaFilter extends MediaFilter</pre></code>
	</p>
	
	<p>You must give your new filter a "name", by adding it and its name to the <code>plugin.named.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.FormatFilter</code> field in <code>dspace.cfg</code>.
	In addition to naming your filter, make sure to specify its input formats in the
	<code>filter.<i>&lt;class path&gt;</i>.inputFormats</code> config item. Note the input formats must match the <code>short description</code> field in the <a href="appendix.html#bitstreamformatregistry">Bitstream Format Registry</a> (i.e. <code>bitstreamformatregistry</code> table).
	<code><pre>
	plugin.named.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.FormatFilter = \
  		org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MySimpleMediaFilter = My Simple Text Filter, \
  		...
  	
  	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MySimpleMediaFilter.inputFormats = Text</pre></code>
	</p>
	
	<em>WARNING: If you neglect to define the <code>inputFormats</code> for
	   a particular filter, the <code>MediaFilterManager</code> will never call that filter, since it will never find a bitstream which has a format
	   matching that filter's input format(s).</em>
	
	<p>If you have a complex Media Filter class, which actually performs different filtering for different formats (e.g. conversion from Word to PDF <strong>and</strong> conversion from Excel to CSV), you should define this as a <a href="selfnamedfilter">Dynamic / Self-Named Format Filter</a>.
	
    <h4>Creating a Dynamic or "Self-Named" Format Filter</h4>	
	<p>If you have a more complex Media/Format Filter, which actually performs <strong>multiple</strong> filtering or conversions for different formats (e.g. conversion from Word to PDF <strong>and</strong> conversion from Excel to CSV), you should have define a class which implements the <code>FormatFilter</code> interface, 
	while also extending the <a href="business.html#selfnamedplugin"><code>SelfNamedPlugin</code></a> class.  For example:
	<code><pre>
	public class MyComplexMediaFilter extends SelfNamedPlugin implements FormatFilter</pre></code>
	</p>

	<p>Since <code>SelfNamedPlugins</code> are self-named (as stated), they must provide the various names the plugin uses by defining a <a href="business.html#pluginmethods">getPluginNames()</a> method</a>.  
	Generally speaking, each "name" the plugin uses should correspond to a different type of filter it implements (e.g. "Word2PDF" and "Excel2CSV" are two good names for a complex media filter which performs both Word to PDF and Excel to CSV conversions).
	</p>
	
	<p>Self-Named Media/Format Filters are also configured differently in <code>dspace.cfg</code>.  Below is a general template for a Self Named Filter (defined by an imaginary <code>MyComplexMediaFilter</code> class, which
	can perform both Word to PDF and Excel to CSV conversions):</p>
	
	<p><code><pre>
	#Add to a list of all Self Named filters
	plugin.selfnamed.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.FormatFilter = \
  		org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MyComplexMediaFilter
  		
	#Define input formats for each "named" plugin this filter implements
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MyComplexMediaFilter.Word2PDF.inputFormats = Microsoft Word
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MyComplexMediaFilter.Excel2CSV.inputFormats = Microsoft Excel</pre>
	</code></p>
	
	<p>As shown above, each Self-Named Filter class must be listed in the <code>plugin.selfnamed.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.FormatFilter</code> item in <code>dspace.cfg</code>.
	   In addition, each Self-Named Filter <strong>must</strong> define the input formats for <em>each named plugin</em> defined by that filter.  
	   In the above example the <code>MyComplexMediaFilter</code> class is assumed to have defined two named plugins, <code>Word2PDF</code> and <code>Excel2CSV</code>. 
	   So, these two valid plugin names ("Word2PDF" and "Excel2CSV") <strong>must</strong> be returned by the <code>getPluginNames()</code> method of the <code>MyComplexMediaFilter</code> class.</p>
	<p>These named plugins take different input formats as defined above (see the corresponding <code>inputFormats</code> setting).  <em>WARNING: If you neglect to define the <code>inputFormats</code> for
	   a particular named plugin, the <code>MediaFilterManager</code> will never call that plugin, since it will never find a bitstream which has a format
	   matching that plugin's input format(s).</em>
	</p>
	
	<p>For a particular Self-Named Filter, you are also welcome to define additional configuration settings in <code>dspace.cfg</code>.
	To continue with our current example, each of our imaginary plugins actually results in a different output format (Word2PDF creates "Adobe PDF", while Excel2CSV creates "Comma Separated Values").
	To allow this complex Media Filter to be even more configurable (especially across institutions, with potential different "Bitstream Format Registries"), you may 
	wish to allow for the output format to be customizable for each named plugin.  For example:</p>
	
	<p><code><pre>
	#Define output formats for each named plugin
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MyComplexMediaFilter.Word2PDF.outputFormat = Adobe PDF
	filter.org.dspace.app.mediafilter.MyComplexMediaFilter.Excel2CSV.outputFormat = Comma Separated Values</pre>
	</code></p>
	
	<p>Any custom configuration fields in <code>dspace.cfg</code> defined by your filter are ignored by the <code>MediaFilterManager</code>, so it is up to your custom media filter class to read those configurations and apply them as necessary.  
	For example, you could use the following sample Java code in your <code>MyComplexMediaFilter</code> class to read these custom <code>outputFormat</code> configurations from <code>dspace.cfg</code> :
	<code><pre>
	//get "outputFormat" configuration from dspace.cfg
	String outputFormat = ConfigurationManager.getProperty(MediaFilterManager.FILTER_PREFIX + "." + 
		MyComplexMediaFilter.class.getName() + "." + this.getPluginInstanceName() + ".outputFormat");</pre></code>
	</p>
	
  <h3><a name="templates" id="templates">Configuration Files for Other Applications</a></h3>

  <p>To ease the hassle of keeping configuration files for other applications involved in running a DSpace site, for example Apache, in sync, the DSpace system can automatically update them for you when the main DSpace configuration is changed. This feature of the DSpace system is entirely optional, but we found it useful.</p>

  <p>The way this is done is by placing the configuration files for those applications in <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/templates</code>, and inserting special values in the configuration file that will be filled out with appropriate DSpace configuration properties. Then, tell DSpace where to put filled-out, 'live' version of the configuration by adding an appropriate property to <code>dspace.cfg</code>, and run <code><i>[dspace]</i>/bin/install-configs</code>.</p>

  <p>Take the <code>apache13.conf</code> file as an example. This contains plenty of Apache-specific stuff, but where it uses a value that should be kept in sync across DSpace and associated applications, a 'placeholder' value is written. For example, the host name:</p>
  <pre>
ServerName @@dspace.hostname@@
</pre>

  <p>The text <code>@@dspace.hostname@@</code> will be filled out with the value of the <code>dspace.hostname</code> property in <code>dspace.cfg</code>. Then we decide where we want the 'live' version, that is, the version actually read in by Apache when it starts up, will go.</p>

  <p>Let's say we want the live version to be located at <code>/opt/apache/conf/dspace-httpd.conf</code>. To do this, we add the following property to <code>dspace.cfg</code> so DSpace knows where to put it:</p>
  <pre>
config.template.apache13.conf = /opt/apache/conf/dspace-httpd.conf
</pre>

  <p>Now, we run <code><i>[dspace]</i>/bin/install-configs</code>. This reads in <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/templates/apache13.conf</code>, and places a copy at <code>/opt/apache/conf/dspace-httpd.conf</code> with the placeholders filled out.</p>

  <p>So, in <code>/opt/apache/conf/dspace-httpd.conf</code>, there will be a line like:</p>
  <pre>
ServerName dspace.myu.edu
</pre>

  <p>The advantage of this approach is that if a property like the hostname changes, you can just change it in <code>dspace.cfg</code> and run <code>install-configs</code>, and all of your tools' configuration files will be updated.</p>

  <p>However, take care to make all your edits to the versions in <code><i>[dspace]</i>/config/templates</code>! It's a wise idea to put a big reminder at the top of each file, since someone might unwittingly edit a 'live' configuration file which would later be overwritten.</p>


<h3><a name="browse-index" id="browse-index">Browse Index Creation</a></h3>

<!-- (ScottPhillips: This should not be here - this isn't describing how to customize dspace it's how to run the index command. Unfortunitaly there is not a good section for it to be place. Perhaps it needs a new top level area?) -->

<p>
To create all the various browse indices that you define in the configuration as described in
the section <a href="#browse">Browse Configuration</a> there are a variety of options available 
to you.  You can see these options at any time by running the indexer without any arguments, thus:
</p>

<pre>
[dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.browse.IndexBrowse
</pre>

<p>This will show you the following options are available to you:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>-r,--rebuild</dt>
	<dd>
	   should we rebuild all the indices, which removes old index
                tables and creates new ones.  For use with -f. Mutually exclusive with -d
    </dd>
    <dt>-s,--start</dt>
    <dd>     [-s &lt;int&gt;] start from this index number and work upward
                (mostly only useful for debugging). For use with -t and -f
                </dd>
     <dt>-x,--execute</dt>
     <dd>   execute all the remove and create SQL against the
                database. For use with -t and -f</dd>
     <dt>-i,--index</dt>
     <dd>     actually do the indexing.  Mutually exclusive with -t and
                -f</dd>
     <dt>-o,--out</dt>
     <dd>      [-o &lt;filename&gt;] write the remove and create SQL to the
                given file. For use with -t and -f</dd>
     <dt>-p,--print</dt>
     <dd>     write the remove and create SQL to the stdout. For use
                with -t and -f</dd>
     <dt>-t,--tables</dt>
     <dd>    create the tables only, do not attempt to index.  Mutually
                exclusive with -f and -i</dd>
     <dt>-f,--full</dt>
     <dd>      make the tables, and do the indexing.  This forces -x.
                Mutually exclusive with -t and -i</dd>
     <dt>-v,--verbose</dt>
     <dd>   print extra information to the stdout.  If used in
                conjunction with -p, you cannot use the stdout to generate your database
                structure</dd>
     <dt>-d,--delete</dt>
     <dd>    delete all the indices, but don't create new ones.  For
                use with -f. This is mutually exclusive with -r</dd>
     <dt>-h,--help</dt>
     <dd>      show this help documentation.  Overrides all other
                arguments</dd>
</dl>

<p>The following, then, are examples of what you want to achieve and how this is done with
the command line options</p>

<p><em>Do a full browse re-index, tearing down all old tables and reconstructing with the new configuration</em></p>

<pre>
[dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.browse.IndexBrowse -f -r
</pre>

<p><em>Do a full browse re-index without modifying the table structure</em> (This should be your default approach if indexing, for example,
via a cron job periodically)</p>

<pre>
[dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.browse.IndexBrowse -i
</pre>

<p><em>Destroy and rebuild the database, but do not do the indexing.  Output the SQL to do this to the screen and a file, as well
as executing it against the database, while being verbose</em></p>

<pre>
[dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.browse.IndexBrowse -r -t -p -v -x -o myfile.sql
</pre>

<p>During installation you will have run the ant target:</p>

<pre>
ant index
</pre>

<p>This creates the index tables as per the configuration, and will produce your initial indexed state.  From this point on, you should
not use ant to generate your indices, as it is not a very good execution environment.  Instead, if you feel the need, or your local
customisations demand regular full indexing you should set up a regular script to execute:</p>

<pre>
[dspace]/bin/dsrun org.dspace.browse.IndexBrowse -i
</pre>
