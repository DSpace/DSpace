<h1><a name="Preface-Preface"></a>Preface</h1>

<p>Welcome to Release 1.7.1&#33; The committers have volunteered many hours to fix, re-write and contribute new software code for this release. Documentation has also been updated. The 1.7.1 bug fix release includes all the new features of 1.7.0 but fixes many known issues discovered since the release of 1.7.0.</p>

	<li>DS-806 Item.match() incorrect logic for schema testing</li>
	<li>DS-823 DatabaseManager is no longer Oracle compliant</li>
	<li>DS-821 AbstractMETSIngester creates an item before adding descriptive metadata</li>

	<li>DSpace Discovery: a faceted browse/search interface for XMLUI that gives a deeper and more intuitive look at repository content</li>
	<li><a href="AIP Backup and Restore.html" title="AIP Backup and Restore">Archival Information Package (AIP) Backup &amp; Restore process</a>: allows for a backup of DSpace into a generic METS-based structure, that can be used to migrate DSpace content to another system that supports AIP's (DSpace or non-DSpace)</li>
	<li><a href="Curation System.html" title="Curation System">Curation System User Interface</a>: allows for a series of curation tasks (profile bitstream formats, virus scan, check for required metadata) to be performed on objects in DSpace</li>
	<li>PowerPoint text extraction, for searching within PowerPoint slides</li>
	<li>Improved <a href="Google Scholar Metadata Mappings.html" title="Google Scholar Metadata Mappings">Google Scholar indexing</a> on metadata and PDF content</li>
	<li>Improved performance and scalability of DSpace: the code has been thoroughly analyzed to provide major performance gains with regard to item ingestion and indexing speed to support larger repositories</li>
	<li>Automated Unit Testing of core code: helps the developers ensure the core code of DSpace is as bug free and stable as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>We apologize to any contributor accidentally left off this list. DSpace has such a large, active development community that we sometimes lose track of all our contributors. Our ongoing list of all known people/institutions that have contributed to DSpace software can be found on our <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceContributors" title="DSpaceContributors">DSpace Contributors page</a>. Acknowledgements to those left off will be made in future releases.  Want to make sure you make it on the short list of contributors?  All you have to do is report an issue, fix a bug or help us determine the necessary requirements for a new feature&#33;  Visit our <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS">Issue Tracker</a> to take part and get your name on the list of DSpace Contributors&#33;</p>

<p>The Documentation Gardener for this release was Jeffrey Trimble with input from everyone. &nbsp;All typos are his fault.</p>

<p>Peter Dietz is the Release Coordinator of this release.  Tim Donohue helped out with coordinating the final days of the release.</p>

<p>Additional thanks to Tim Donohue from DuraSpace on keeping all of us focused on the work at hand, and calming us when we got excited and for the general support for the DSpace project.</p>
