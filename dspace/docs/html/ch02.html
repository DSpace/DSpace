        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="image/data-model.gif" width="585"></span>
      </p><p>Data Model Diagram</p><p>The way data is organized in DSpace is intended to reflect the structure of the organization using the DSpace system. Each DSpace site is divided into <span class="emphasis"><em>communities</em></span>, which can be further divided into <span class="emphasis"><em>sub-communities</em></span> reflecting the typical university structure of college, departement, research center, or laboratory.</p><p>Communities contain <span class="emphasis"><em>collections</em></span>, which are groupings of related content. A collection may appear in more than one community.</p><p>Each collection is composed of <span class="emphasis"><em>items</em></span>, which are the basic archival elements of the archive. Each item is owned by one collection. Additionally, an item may appear in additional collections; however every item has one and only one owning collection.</p><p>Items are further subdivided into named <span class="emphasis"><em>bundles</em></span> of <span class="emphasis"><em>bitstreams</em></span>. Bitstreams are, as the name suggests, streams of bits, usually ordinary computer files. Bitstreams that are somehow closely related, for example HTML files and images that compose a single HTML document, are organised into bundles.</p><p>In practice, most items tend to have these named bundles:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>ORIGINAL</em></span>  -- the bundle with the original, deposited bitstreams</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>THUMBNAILS</em></span>  -- thumbnails of any image bitstreams</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>TEXT</em></span>  -- extracted full-text from bitstreams in ORIGINAL, for indexing</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>LICENSE</em></span>  -- contains the deposit license that the submitter granted the host organization; in other words, specifies the rights that the hosting organization have</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>CC_LICENSE</em></span>  -- contains the distribution license, if any (a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.creativecommons.org" target="_top">Creative Commons</a> license) associated with the item. This license specifies what end users downloading the content can do with the content</p></li></ul></div><p>Each bitstream is associated with one <span class="emphasis"><em>Bitstream Format</em></span>. Because preservation services may be an important aspect of the DSpace service, it is important to capture the specific formats of files that users submit. In DSpace, a bitstream format is a unique and consistent way to refer to a particular file format. An integral part of a bitstream format is an either implicit or explicit notion of how material in that format can be interpreted. For example, the interpretation for bitstreams encoded in the JPEG standard for still image compression is defined explicitly in the Standard ISO/IEC 10918-1. The interpretation of bitstreams in Microsoft Word 2000 format is defined implicitly, through reference to the Microsoft Word 2000 application. Bitstream formats can be more specific than MIME types or file suffixes. For example, <code class="literal">application/ms-word</code> and <code class="literal">.doc</code> span multiple versions of the Microsoft Word application, each of which produces bitstreams with presumably different characteristics.</p><p>Each bitstream format additionally has a <span class="emphasis"><em>support level</em></span>, indicating how well the hosting institution is likely to be able to preserve content in the format in the future. There are three possible support levels that bitstream formats may be assigned by the hosting institution. The host institution should determine the exact meaning of each support level, after careful consideration of costs and requirements. MIT Libraries' interpretation is shown below:</p><div class="table"><a name="N10100"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;MIT Libraries' Definitions of Bitstream Format Support Levels</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="MIT Libraries' Definitions of Bitstream Format Support Levels" border="0"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

It creates and organizes components (plugins), and helps select a plugin in the cases where there are many possible choices. It also gives some limited control over the lifecycle of a plugin.</p><p>A plugin is defined by a Java interface. The consumer of a plugin asks for its plugin by interface.

The <a class="ulink" href="http://dspace.org/technology/metadata.html" target="_top">set of elements and qualifiers used by MIT Libraries</a> comes pre-configured with the DSpace source code. However, you can configure multiple schemas and select metadata fields from a mix of configured schemas to describe your items.</p><p>Other descriptive metadata about items (e.g. metadata described in a hierarchical schema) may be held in serialized bitstreams. <span class="emphasis"><em>Communities</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>collections</em></span> have some simple descriptive metadata (a name, and some descriptive prose), held in the DBMS.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Administrative Metadata</span></dt><dd><p> This includes preservation metadata, provenance and authorization policy data. Most of this is held within DSpace's relation DBMS schema. Provenance metadata (prose) is stored in Dublin Core records. Additionally, some other administrative metadata (for example, bitstream byte sizes and MIME types) is replicated in Dublin Core records so that it is easily accessible outside of DSpace.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Structural Metadata</span></dt><dd><p> This includes information about how to present an item, or bitstreams within an item, to an end-user, and the relationships between constituent parts of the item. As an example, consider a thesis consisting of a number of TIFF images, each depicting a single page of the thesis. Structural metadata would include the fact that each image is a single page, and the ordering of the TIFF images/pages. Structural metadata in DSpace is currently fairly basic; within an item, bitstreams can be arranged into separate bundles as <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-data_model">described above</a>. A bundle may also optionally have a <span class="emphasis"><em>primary bitstream</em></span>. This is currently used by the <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-html">HTML support</a> to indicate which bitstream in the bundle is the first HTML file to send to a browser.</p><p>In addition to some basic technical metadata, bitstreams also have a 'sequence ID' that uniquely identifies it within an item. This is used to produce a <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-bitstream_ids">'persistent' bitstream identifier</a> for each bitstream.</p><p>Additional structural metadata can be stored in serialized bitstreams, but DSpace does not currently understand this natively.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N101F5"></a>2.4.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-packager"></a>Packager Plugins</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Packagers</em></span> are software modules that translate between DSpace Item objects and a self-contained external representation, or "package". A <span class="emphasis"><em>Package Ingester</em></span> interprets, or <span class="emphasis"><em>ingests</em></span>, the package and creates an Item. A <span class="emphasis"><em>Package Disseminator</em></span> writes out the contents of an Item in the package format.</p><p>A package is typically an archive file such as a Zip or "tar" file, including a <span class="emphasis"><em>manifest</em></span> document which contains metadata and a description of the package contents. The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.imsglobal.org/content/packaging/" target="_top">IMS Content Package</a> is a typical packaging standard. A package might also be a single document or media file that contains its own metadata, such as a PDF document with embedded descriptive metadata.</p><p>Package ingesters and package disseminators are each a type of named plugin (see <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-plugin">Plugin Manager</a>), so it is easy to add new packagers specific to the needs of your site. You do not have to supply both an ingester and disseminator for each format; it is perfectly acceptable to just implement one of them.</p><p>Most packager plugins call upon Crosswalk plugins to translate the metadata between DSpace's object model and the package format.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N1021A"></a>2.5.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-crosswalk"></a>Crosswalk Plugins</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Crosswalks</em></span> are software modules that translate between DSpace object metadata and a specific external representation. An <span class="emphasis"><em>Ingestion Crosswalk</em></span> interprets the external format and crosswalks it to DSpace's internal data structure, while a <span class="emphasis"><em>Dissemination Crosswalk</em></span> does the opposite.</p><p>For example, a MODS ingestion crosswalk translates descriptive metadata from the MODS format to the metadata fields on a DSpace Item. A MODS dissemination crosswalk generates a MODS document from the metadata on a DSpace Item.</p><p>Crosswalk plugins are named plugins see <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-plugin">Plugin Manager</a>), so it is easy to add new crosswalks.

Both E-People and Groups are granted privileges by the <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-auth">authorization</a> system described below.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N1024C"></a>2.6.1.&nbsp;E-Person</h3></div></div></div><p>DSpace hold the following information about each e-person:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> E-mail address</p></li><li><p> First and last names</p></li><li><p> Whether the user is able to log in to the system via the Web UI, and whether they must use an X509 certificate to do so;</p></li><li><p> A password (encrypted), if appropriate</p></li><li><p> A list of collections for which the e-person wishes to be notified of new items</p></li><li><p> Whether the e-person 'self-registered' with the system; that is, whether the system created the e-person record automatically as a result of the end-user independently registering with the system, as opposed to the e-person record being generated from the institution's personnel database, for example.</p></li><li><p> The network ID for the corresponding LDAP record</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N10268"></a>2.6.2.&nbsp;Groups</h3></div></div></div><p>Groups are another kind of entity that can be granted permissions in the <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-auth">authorization</a> system.

For example, some sites use this feature to identify users of a local network so they can read restricted materials not open to the whole world.

In DSpace 1.4, it is implemented by a mechanism called <span class="emphasis"><em>Stackable Authentication</em></span>: the DSpace configuration declares a "stack" of authentication methods. An application (like the Web UI) calls on the Authentication Manager, which tries each of these methods in turn to identify the E-Person to which the session belongs, as well as any extra Groups. The E-Person authentication methods are tried in turn until one succeeds. Every authenticator in the stack is given a chance to assign extra Groups. This mechanism offers the following advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> Separates authentication from the Web user interface so the same authentication methods are used for other applications such as non-interactive Web Services</p></li><li><p> Improved modularity: The authentication methods are all independent of each other.

The associations are called Resource Policies, and the lists of EPeople are called Groups. There are two special groups: 'Administrators', who can do anything in a site, and 'Anonymous', which is a list that contains all users. Assigning a policy for an action on an object to anonymous means giving everyone permission to do that action. (For example, most objects in DSpace sites have a policy of 'anonymous' READ.) Permissions must be explicit - lack of an explicit permission results in the default policy of 'deny'. Permissions also do not 'commute'; for example, if an e-person has READ permission on an item, they might not necessarily have READ permission on the bundles and bitstreams in that item. Currently Collections, Communities and Items are discoverable in the browse and search systems regardless of READ authorization.</p><p>The following actions are possible:</p><p>

      </p><p>DSpace Ingest Process</p><p>The batch item importer is an application, which turns an external SIP (an XML metadata document with some content files) into an "in progress submission" object. The Web submission UI is similarly used by an end-user to assemble an "in progress submission" object.</p><p>Depending on the policy of the collection to which the submission in targeted, a workflow process may be started. This typically allows one or more human reviewers or 'gatekeepers' to check over the submission and ensure it is suitable for inclusion in the collection.</p><p>When the Batch Ingester or Web Submit UI completes the InProgressSubmission object, and invokes the next stage of ingest (be that workflow or item installation), a provenance message is added to the Dublin Core which includes the filenames and checksums of the content of the submission. Likewise, each time a workflow changes state (e.g. a reviewer accepts the submission), a similar provenance statement is added. This allows us to track how the item has changed since a user submitted it. </p><p>Once any workflow process is successfully and positively completed, the InProgressSubmission object is consumed by an "item installer", that converts the InProgressSubmission into a fully blown archived item in DSpace. The item installer:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> Assigns an accession date</p></li><li><p> Adds a "date.available" value to the Dublin Core metadata record of the item</p></li><li><p> Adds an issue date if none already present</p></li><li><p> Adds a provenance message (including bitstream checksums)</p></li><li><p> Assigns a <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-handles">Handle</a> persistent identifier</p></li><li><p> Adds the item to the target collection, and adds appropriate authorization policies</p></li><li><p> Adds the new item to the search and browse indices</p></li></ul></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N103A5"></a>2.9.1.&nbsp;Workflow Steps</h3></div></div></div><p>A collection's workflow can have up to three steps. Each collection may have an associated e-person group for performing each step; if no group is associated with a certain step, that step is skipped. If a collection has no e-person groups associated with any step, submissions to that collection are installed straight into the main archive.</p><p>In other words, the sequence is this: The collection receives a submission. If the collection has a group assigned for workflow step 1, that step is invoked, and the group is notified. Otherwise, workflow step 1 is skipped. Likewise, workflow steps 2 and 3 are performed if and only if the collection has a group assigned to those steps.</p><p>When a step is invoked, the task of performing that workflow step put in the 'task pool' of the associated group. One member of that group takes the task from the pool, and it is then removed from the task pool, to avoid the situation where several people in the group may be performing the same task without realizing it.</p><p>The member of the group who has taken the task from the pool may then perform one of three actions:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

If there are no more workflow steps with associated groups, the submission is installed in the main archive.</p><p>One last possibility is that a workflow can be 'aborted' by a DSpace site administrator. This is accomplished using the administration UI.</p><p>The reason for this apparently arbitrary design is that is was the simplist case that covered the needs of the early adopter communities at MIT. The functionality of the workflow system will no doubt be extended in the future.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N10404"></a>2.10.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-supervision"></a>Supervision and Collaboration</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to facilitate, as a primary objective, the opportunity for thesis authors to be supervised in the preparation of their e-thesis, a supervision order system exists to bind groups of other users (thesis supervisors) to an item in someone's pre-submission workspace.

The simple evolution from sharing of citations to emailing of URLs broke when Web users learned that sites can disappear or be reconfigured without notice, and that their bookmark files containing critical links to research results couldn't be trusted long term. To help solve this problem, a core DSpace feature is the creation of persistent identifier for every item, collection and community stored in DSpace. To persist identifier, DSpace requires a storage- and location- independent mechanism for creating and maintaining identifiers. DSpace uses the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.handle.net/" target="_top">CNRI Handle System</a> for creating these identifiers. The rest of this section assumes a basic familiarity with the Handle system.</p><p>DSpace uses Handles primarily as a means of assigning globally unique identifiers to objects. Each site running DSpace needs to obtain a Handle 'prefix' from CNRI, so we know that if we create identifiers with that prefix, they won't clash with identifiers created elsewhere.</p><p>Presently, Handles are assigned to communities, collections, and items. Bundles and bitstreams are not assigned Handles, since over time, the way in which an item is encoded as bits may change, in order to allow access with future technologies and devices. Older versions may be moved to off-line storage as a new standard becomes de facto. Since it's usually the <span class="emphasis"><em>item</em></span> that is being preserved, rather than the particular bit encoding, it only makes sense to persistently identify and allow access to the item, and allow users to access the appropriate bit encoding from there.</p><p>Of course, it may be that a particular bit encoding of a file is explicitly being preserved; in this case, the bitstream could be the only one in the item, and the item's Handle would then essentially refer just to that bitstream. The same bitstream can also be included in other items, and thus would be citable as part of a greater item, or individually.</p><p>The Handle system also features a global resolution infrastructure; that is, an end-user can enter a Handle into any service (e.g. Web page) that can resolve Handles, and the end-user will be directed to the object (in the case of DSpace, community, collection or item) identified by that Handle. In order to take advantage of this feature of the Handle system, a DSpace site must also run a 'Handle server' that can accept and resolve incoming resolution requests. All the code for this is included in the DSpace source code bundle.</p><p>Handles can be written in two forms:</p><pre class="screen">
hdl:1721.123/4567
http://hdl.handle.net/1721.123/4567
</pre><p>The above represent the same Handle. The first is possibly more convenient to use only as an identifier; however, by using the second form, any Web browser becomes capable of resolving Handles. An end-user need only access this form of the Handle as they would any other URL. It is possible to enable some browsers to resolve the first form of Handle as if they were standard URLs using <a class="ulink" href="http://www.handle.net/resolver/index.html" target="_top">CNRI's Handle Resolver plug-in</a>, but since the first form can always be simply derived from the second, DSpace displays Handles in the second form, so that it is more useful for end-users.</p><p>It is important to note that DSpace uses the CNRI Handle infrastructure only at the 'site' level. For example, in the above example, the DSpace site has been assigned the prefix '1721.123'. It is still the responsibility of the DSpace site to maintain the association between a full Handle (including the '4567' local part) and the community, collection or item in question.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N10440"></a>2.12.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-bitstream_ids"></a>Bitstream 'Persistent' Identifiers</h2></div></div></div><p>Similar to handles for DSpace items, bitstreams also have 'Persistent' identifiers. They are more volatile than Handles, since if the content is moved to a different server or organizaion, they will no longer work (hence the quotes around 'persistent'). However, they are more easily persisted than the simple URLs based on database primary key previously used. This means that external systems can more reliably refer to specific bitstreams stored in a DSpace instance.</p><p>Each bitstream has a sequence ID, unique within an item. This sequence ID is used to create a persistent ID, of the form:</p><p>
        <code class="literal">dspace url/bitstream/handle/sequence ID/filename</code>
      </p><p>For example:</p><pre class="screen">
https://dspace.myu.edu/bitstream/123.456/789/24/foo.html
</pre><p>The above refers to the bitstream with sequence ID 24 in the item with the Handle <code class="literal">hdl:123.456/789</code>. The <code class="literal">foo.html</code> is really just there as a hint to browsers: Although DSpace will provide the appropriate MIME type, some browsers only function correctly if the file has an expected extension.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N10460"></a>2.13.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-srb"></a>Storage Resource Broker (SRB) Support</h2></div></div></div><p>DSpace offers two means for storing bitstreams. The first is in the file system on the server. The second is using <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sdsc.edu/srb" target="_top">SRB (Storage Resource Broker)</a>. Both are achieved using a simple, lightweight API.</p><p>SRB is purely an option but may be used in lieu of the server's file system or in addition to the file system. Without going into a full description, SRB is a very robust, sophisticated storage manager that offers essentially unlimited storage and straightforward means to replicate (in simple terms, backup) the content on other local or remote storage resources.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N1046F"></a>2.14.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-search_browse"></a>Search and Browse</h2></div></div></div><p>DSpace allows end-users to discover content in a number of ways, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> Via external reference, such as a Handle</p></li><li><p> Searching for one or more keywords in metadata or extracted full-text</p></li><li><p> Browsing though title, author, date or subject indices, with optional image thumbnails</p></li></ul></div><p>Search is an essential component of discovery in DSpace. Users' expectations from a search engine are quite high, so a goal for DSpace is to supply as many search features as possible. DSpace's indexing and search module has a very simple API which allows for indexing new content, regenerating the index, and performing searches on the entire corpus, a community, or collection. Behind the API is the Java freeware search engine <a class="ulink" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/" target="_top">Lucene</a>. Lucene gives us fielded searching, stop word removal, stemming, and the ability to incrementally add new indexed content without regenerating the entire index. The specific Lucene search indexes are configurable enabling institutions to customize which DSpace metadata fields are indexed.</p><p>Another important mechanism for discovery in DSpace is the browse. This is the process whereby the user views a particular index, such as the title index, and navigates around it in search of interesting items. The browse subsystem provides a simple API for achieving this by allowing a caller to specify an index, and a subsection of that index. The browse subsystem then discloses the portion of the index of interest. Indices that may be browsed are item title, item issue date, item author, and subject terms. Additionally, the browse can be limited to items within a particular collection or community.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N1048A"></a>2.15.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-html"></a>HTML Support</h2></div></div></div><p>For the most part, at present DSpace simply supports uploading and downloading of bitstreams as-is. This is fine for the majority of commonly-used file formats -- for example PDFs, Microsoft Word documents, spreadsheets and so forth. HTML documents (Web sites and Web pages) are far more complicated, and this has important ramifications when it comes to digital preservation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> Web pages tend to consist of several files -- one or more HTML files that contain references to each other, and stylesheets and image files that are referenced by the HTML files.</p></li><li><p> Web pages also link to or include content from other sites, often imperceptably to the end-user. Thus, in a few year's time, when someone views the preserved Web site, they will probably find that many links are now broken or refer to other sites than are now out of context.</p><p>In fact, it may be unclear to an end-user when they are viewing content stored in DSpace and when they are seeing content included from another site, or have navigated to a page that is not stored in DSpace. This problem can manifest when a submitter uploads some HTML content. For example, the HTML document may include an image from an external Web site, or even their local hard drive. When the submitter views the HTML in DSpace, their browser is able to use the reference in the HTML to retrieve the appropriate image, and so to the submitter, the whole HTML document appears to have been deposited correctly. However, later on, when another user tries to view that HTML, their browser might not be able to retrieve the included image since it may have been removed from the external server. Hence the HTML will seem broken.</p></li><li><p> Often Web pages are produced dynamically by software running on the Web server, and represent the state of a changing database underneath it.</p></li></ul></div><p>Dealing with these issues is the topic of much active research. Currently, DSpace bites off a small, tractable chunk of this problem. DSpace can store and provide on-line browsing capability for <span class="emphasis"><em>self-contained, non-dynamic</em></span> HTML documents. In practical terms, this means:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> No dynamic content (CGI scripts and so forth)</p></li><li><p> All links to preserved content must be <span class="emphasis"><em>relative links</em></span>, that do not refer to 'parents' above the 'root' of the HTML document/site: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p><code class="literal">diagram.gif</code>  is OK</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">image/foo.gif</code>  is OK</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">../index.html</code>  is only OK in a file that is at least a directory deep in the HTML document/site hierarchy</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">/stylesheet.css</code>  is not OK (the link will break)</p></li><li><p><code class="literal">http://somedomain.com/content.html</code>  is not OK (the link will continue to link to the external site which may change or disappear)</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p> Any 'absolute links' (e.g. <code class="literal">http://somedomain.com/content.html</code>) are stored 'as is', and will continue to link to the external content (as opposed to relative links, which will link to the copy of the content stored in DSpace.) Thus, over time, the content refered to by the absolute link may change or disappear.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N104D4"></a>2.16.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-functional.html-oai"></a>OAI Support</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_top">Open Archives Initiative</a> has developed a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html" target="_top">protocol for metadata harvesting</a>. This allows sites to programmatically retrieve or 'harvest' the metadata from several sources, and offer services using that metadata, such as indexing or linking services. Such a service could allow users to access information from a large number of sites from one place.</p><p>DSpace exposes the Dublin Core metadata for items that are publicly (anonymously) accessible. Additionally, the collection structure is also exposed via the OAI protocol's 'sets' mechanism.

If your institution has an SFX server, DSpace will display an OpenURL link on every item page, automatically using the Dublin Core metadata. Additionally, DSpace can respond to incoming OpenURLs.
