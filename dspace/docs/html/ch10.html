          <span class="bold"><strong>When editing configuration files for applications that DSpace uses, such as Apache, remember to edit the file in /dspace/config/templates and then run /dspace/bin/install-configs rather than editing the 'live' version directly!</strong></span>
        </p><p>The <code class="literal">ConfigurationManager</code> class can also be invoked as a command line tool, with two possible uses:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><pre class="screen">

                <code class="literal"> /dspace/bin/install-configs</code>

              </pre>
 This processes and installs configuration files for other applications, as described in the <a class="link" href="ch05.html#docbook-configure.html-templates">configuration section</a>.</p></li><li><p><pre class="screen">

                <code class="literal"> /dspace/bin/dsrun
	org.dspace.core.ConfigurationManager -property
	property.name</code>

              </pre>
 This writes the value of <code class="literal">property.name</code> from <code class="literal">dspace.cfg</code> to the standard output, so that shell scripts can access the DSpace configuration. For an example, see <code class="literal">/dspace/bin/start-handle-server</code>. If the property has no value, nothing is written.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N13BCF"></a>10.1.2.&nbsp;Constants</h3></div></div></div><p>This class contains constants that are used to represent types of object and actions in the database. For example, authorization policies can relate to objects of different types, so the <code class="literal">resourcepolicy</code> table has columns <code class="literal">resource_id</code>, which is the internal ID of the object, and <code class="literal">resource_type_id</code>, which indicates whether the object is an item, collection, bitstream etc. The value of <code class="literal">resource_type_id</code> is taken from the <code class="literal">Constants</code> class, for example <code class="literal">Constants.ITEM</code>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N13BED"></a>10.1.3.&nbsp;Context</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">Context</code> class is central to the DSpace operation. Any code that wishes to use the any API in the business logic layer must first create itself a <code class="literal">Context</code> object. This is akin to opening a connection to a database (which is in fact one of the things that happens.)</p><p>A context object is involved in most method calls and object constructors, so that the method or object has access to information about the current operation. When the context object is constructed, the following information is automatically initialized:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> A connection to the database. This is a transaction-safe connection. i.e. the 'auto-commit' flag is set to false.</p></li><li><p> A cache of content management API objects. Each time a content object is created (for example <code class="literal">Item</code> or <code class="literal">Bitstream</code>) it is stored in the <code class="literal">Context</code> object. If the object is then requested again, the cached copy is used. Apart from reducing database use, this addresses the problem of having two copies of the same object in memory in different states.</p></li></ul></div><p>The following information is also held in a context object, though it is the responsiblity of the application creating the context object to fill it out correctly:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> The current authenticated user, if any</p></li><li><p> Any 'special groups' the user is a member of. For example, a user might automatically be part of a particular group based on the IP address they are accessing DSpace from, even though they don't have an e-person record. Such a group is called a 'special group'.</p></li><li><p> Any extra information from the application layer that should be added to log messages that are written within this context. For example, the Web UI adds a session ID, so that when the logs are analysed the actions of a particular user in a particular session can be tracked.</p></li><li><p> A flag indicating whether authorization should be circumvented. This should only be used in rare, specific circumstances. For example, when first installing the system, there are no authorized administrators who would be able to create an administrator account!</p><p>As noted above, the public API is <span class="emphasis"><em>trusted</em></span>, so it is up to applications in the application layer to use this flag responsibly.</p></li></ul></div><p>Typical use of the context object will involve constructing one, and setting the current user if one is authenticated. Several operations may be performed using the context object. If all goes well, <code class="literal">complete</code> is called to commit the changes and free up any resources used by the context. If anything has gone wrong, <code class="literal">abort</code> is called to roll back any changes and free up the resources.</p><p>You should always <code class="literal">abort</code> a context if <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> error happens during its lifespan; otherwise the data in the system may be left in an inconsistent state. You can also <code class="literal">commit</code> a context, which means that any changes are written to the database, and the context is kept active for further use.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N13C3B"></a>10.1.4.&nbsp;Email</h3></div></div></div><p>Sending e-mails is pretty easy. Just use the configuration manager's <code class="literal">getEmail</code> method, set the arguments and recipients, and send.</p><p>The e-mail texts are stored in <code class="literal">/dspace/config/emails</code>. They are processed by the standard <code class="literal">java.text.MessageFormat</code>. At the top of each e-mail are listed the appropriate arguments that should be filled out by the sender. Example usage is shown in the <code class="literal">org.dspace.core.Email</code> Javadoc API documentation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N13C53"></a>10.1.5.&nbsp;LogManager</h3></div></div></div><p>The log manager consists of a method that creates a standard log header, and returns it as a string suitable for logging. Note that this class does not actually write anything to the logs; the log header returned should be logged directly by the sender using an appropriate Log4J call, so that information about where the logging is taking place is also stored.</p><p>The level of logging can be configured on a per-package or per-class basis by editing <code class="literal">/dspace/config/templates/log4j.properties</code> and then executing <code class="literal">/dspace/bin/install-configs</code>. You will need to stop and restart Tomcat for the changes to take effect.</p><p>A typical log entry looks like this:</p><p>

This is the API that components in the application layer will probably use most.</p><p>Classes corresponding to the main elements in the <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-data_model">DSpace data model</a> (<code class="literal">Community</code>, <code class="literal">Collection</code>, <code class="literal">Item</code>, <code class="literal">Bundle</code> and <code class="literal">Bitstream</code>) are sub-classes of the abstract class <code class="literal">DSpaceObject</code>. The <code class="literal">Item</code> object handles the Dublin Core metadata record.</p><p>Each class generally has one or more static <code class="literal">find</code> methods, which are used to instantiate content objects. Constructors do not have public access and are just used internally. The reasons for this are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> "Constructing" an object may be misconstrued as the action of creating an object in the DSpace system, for example one might expect something like:</p><pre class="screen">
Context dsContent = new Context();
Item myItem = new Item(context, id)
</pre><p>to construct a brand new item in the system, rather than simply instantiating an in-memory instance of an object in the system.</p></li><li><p> <code class="literal">find</code> methods may often be called with invalid IDs, and return <code class="literal">null</code> in such a case. A constructor would have to throw an exception in this case. A <code class="literal">null</code> return value from a static method can in general be dealt with more simply in code.</p></li><li><p> If an instantiation representing the same underlying archival entity already exists, the <code class="literal">find</code> method can simply return that same instantiation to avoid multiple copies and any inconsistencies which might result.</p></li></ul></div><p><code class="literal">Collection</code>, <code class="literal">Bundle</code> and <code class="literal">Bitstream</code> do not have <code class="literal">create</code> methods; rather, one has to create an object using the relevant method on the container. For example, to create a collection, one must invoke <code class="literal">createCollection</code> on the community that the collection is to appear in:</p><pre class="screen">
Context context = new Context();
Community existingCommunity = Community.find(context, 123);
Collection myNewCollection = existingCommunity.createCollection();
</pre><p>The primary reason for this is for determining authorization. In order to know whether an e-person may create an object, the system must know which container the object is to be added to. It makes no sense to create a collection outside of a community, and the authorization system does not have a policy for that.</p><p><code class="literal">Item</code>s are first created in the form of an implementation of <code class="literal">InProgressSubmission</code>. An <code class="literal">InProgressSubmission</code> represents an item under construction; once it is complete, it is installed into the main archive and added to the relevant collection by the <code class="literal">InstallItem</code> class. The <code class="literal">org.dspace.content</code> package provides an implementation of <code class="literal">InProgressSubmission</code> called <code class="literal">WorkspaceItem</code>; this is a simple implementation that contains some fields used by the Web submission UI. The <code class="literal">org.dspace.workflow</code> also contains an implementation called <code class="literal">WorkflowItem</code> which represents a submission undergoing a workflow process.</p><p>In the previous chapter there is an <a class="link" href="ch02.html#docbook-functional.html-ingest">overview of the item ingest process</a> which should clarify the previous paragraph. Also see the section on <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-workflow">the workflow system</a>.</p><p><code class="literal">Community</code> and <code class="literal">BitstreamFormat</code> do have static <code class="literal">create</code> methods; one must be a site administrator to have authorization to invoke these.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N13DEA"></a>10.2.1.&nbsp;Other Classes</h3></div></div></div><p>Classes whose name begins <code class="literal">DC</code> are for manipulating Dublin Core metadata, as <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-dublincore">explained below</a>.</p><p>The <code class="literal">FormatIdentifier</code> class attempts to guess the bitstream format of a particular bitstream. Presently, it does this simply by looking at any file extension in the bitstream name and matching it up with the file extensions associated with bitstream formats. Hopefully this can be greatly improved in the future!</p><p>The <code class="literal">ItemIterator</code> class allows items to be retrieved from storage one at a time, and is returned by methods that may return a large number of items, more than would be desirable to have in memory at once.</p><p>The <code class="literal">ItemComparator</code> class is an implementation of the standard <code class="literal">java.util.Comparator</code> that can be used to compare and order items based on a particular Dublin Core metadata field.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N13E0E"></a>10.2.2.&nbsp;Modifications</h3></div></div></div><p>When creating, modifying or for whatever reason removing data with the content management API, it is important to know when changes happen in-memory, and when they occur in the physical DSpace storage.</p><p>Primarily, one should note that no change made using a particular <code class="literal">org.dspace.core.Context</code> object will actually be made in the underlying storage unless <code class="literal">complete</code> or <code class="literal">commit</code> is invoked on that <code class="literal">Context</code>. If anything should go wrong during an operation, the context should always be aborted by invoking <code class="literal">abort</code>, to ensure that no inconsistent state is written to the storage.</p><p>Additionally, some changes made to objects only happen in-memory. In these cases, invoking the <code class="literal">update</code> method lines up the in-memory changes to occur in storage when the <code class="literal">Context</code> is committed or completed. In general, methods that change any [meta]data field only make the change in-memory; methods that involve relationships with other objects in the system line up the changes to be committed with the context. See individual methods in the API Javadoc.</p><p>Some examples to illustrate this are shown below:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

The consumer of a plugin asks for its plugin by interface.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>Plugin</strong></span> a.k.a. Component, this is an instance of a class that implements a certain interface. It is interchangeable with other implementations, so that any of them may be "plugged in", hence the name. A Plugin is an instance of any class that implements the plugin interface.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>Implementation class</strong></span> The actual class of a plugin. It may implement several plugin interfaces, but must implement at least one.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>Name</strong></span> Plugin implementations can be distinguished from each other by name, a short String meant to symbolically represent the implementation class. They are called "named plugins". Plugins only need to be named when the caller has to make an active choice between them.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>SelfNamedPlugin class</strong></span> Plugins that extend the <code class="literal">SelfNamedPlugin</code> class can take advantage of additional features of the Plugin Manager. Any class can be managed as a plugin, so it is not necessary, just possible.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>Reusable</strong></span> Reusable plugins are only instantiated once, and the Plugin Manager returns the same (cached) instance whenever that same plugin is requested again. This behavior can be turned off if desired.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N14057"></a>10.3.2.&nbsp;Using the Plugin Manager</h3></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N1405B"></a>Types of Plugin</h4></div></div></div><p>The Plugin Manager supports three different patterns of usage:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>Singleton Plugins</strong></span> There is only one implementation class for the plugin. It is indicated in the configuration. This type of plugin chooses an implementation of a service, for the entire system, at configuration time. Your application just fetches the plugin for that interface and gets the configured-in choice. See the <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-pluginmethods">getSinglePlugin()</a> method.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>Sequence Plugins</strong></span> You need a sequence or series of plugins, to implement a mechanism like Stackable Authentication or a pipeline, where each plugin is called in order to contribute its implementation of a process to the whole. The Plugin Manager supports this by letting you configure a sequence of plugins for a given interface. See the <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-pluginmethods">getPluginSequence()</a> method.</p></li><li><p><span class="bold"><strong>Named Plugins</strong></span> Use a named plugin when the application has to choose one plugin implementation out of many available ones. Each implementation is bound to one or more names (symbolic identifiers) in the configuration.</p><p>The name is just a string to be associated with the combination of implementation class and interface. It may contain any characters except for comma (,) and equals (=). It may contain embedded spaces. Comma is a special character used to separate names in the configuration entry.</p><p>Names must be unique within an interface: No plugin classes implementing the same interface may have the same name.</p><p>Think of plugin names as a controlled vocabulary -- for a given plugin interface, there is a set of names for which plugins can be found. The designer of a Named Plugin interface is responsible for deciding what the name means and how to derive it; for example, names of metadata crosswalk plugins may describe the target metadata format.</p><p>See the <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-pluginmethods">getNamedPlugin()</a> method and the getPluginNames() methods.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N1408A"></a><a name="docbook-business.html-selfnamedplugin"></a>Self-Named Plugins</h4></div></div></div><p>Named plugins can get their names either from the configuration or, for a variant called self-named plugins, from within the plugin itself.</p><p>Self-named plugins are necessary because one plugin implementation can be configured itself to take on many "personalities", each of which deserves its own plugin name. It is already managing its own configuration for each of these personalities, so it makes sense to allow it to export them to the Plugin Manager rather than expecting the plugin configuration to be kept in sync with it own configuration.</p><p>An example helps clarify the point: There is a named plugin that does crosswalks, call it <code class="literal">CrosswalkPlugin</code>. It has several implementations that crosswalk some kind of metadata. Now we add a new plugin which uses XSL stylesheet transformation (XSLT) to crosswalk many types of metadata -- so the single plugin can act like many different plugins, depending on which stylesheet it employs.</p><p>This XSLT-crosswalk plugin has its own configuration that maps a Plugin Name to a stylesheet -- it has to, since of course the Plugin Manager doesn't know anything about stylesheets. It becomes a self-named plugin, so that it reads its configuration data, gets the list of names to which it can respond, and passes those on to the Plugin Manager.</p><p>When the Plugin Manager creates an instance of the XSLT-crosswalk, it records the Plugin Name that was responsible for that instance. The plugin can look at that Name later in order to configure itself correctly for the Name that created it. This mechanism is all part of the SelfNamedPlugin class which is part of any self-named plugin.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N1409F"></a>Obtaining a Plugin Instance</h4></div></div></div><p>The most common thing you will do with the Plugin Manager is obtain an instance of a plugin. To request a plugin, you must always specify the plugin interface you want. You will also supply a name when asking for a named plugin.</p><p>A sequence plugin is returned as an array of <code class="literal">Object</code>s since it is actually an ordered list of plugins.</p><p>See the <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-pluginmethods">getSinglePlugin(), getPluginSequence(), getNamedPlugin()</a> methods.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N140B1"></a>Lifecycle Management</h4></div></div></div><p>When <code class="literal">PluginManager</code> fulfills a request for a plugin, it checks whether the implementation class is reusable; if so, it creates one instance of that class and returns it for every subsequent request for that interface and name. If it is not reusable, a new instance is always created.</p><p>For reasons that will become clear later, the manager actually caches a separate instance of an implementation class for each name under which it can be requested.</p><p>You can ask the <code class="literal">PluginManager</code> to forget about (decache) a plugin instance, by releasing it. See the <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-pluginmethods">PluginManager.releasePlugin()</a> method. The manager will drop its reference to the plugin so the garbage collector can reclaim it. The next time that plugin/name combination is requested, it will create a new instance.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N140C7"></a>Getting Meta-Information</h4></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">PluginManager</code> can list all the names of the Named Plugins which implement an interface. You may need this, for example, to implement a menu in a user interface that presents a choice among all possible plugins. See the <a class="link" href="ch10.html#docbook-business.html-pluginmethods">getPluginNames()</a> method.</p><p>Note that it only returns the plugin name, so if you need a more sophisticated or meaningful "label" (i.e. a key into the I18N message catalog) then you should add a method to the plugin itself to return that.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N140D7"></a>10.3.3.&nbsp;Implementation</h3></div></div></div><p>Note: The <code class="literal">PluginManager</code> refers to interfaces and classes internally only by their names whenever possible, to avoid loading classes until absolutely necessary (i.e. to create an instance). As you'll see below, self-named classes still have to be loaded to query them for names, but for the most part it can avoid loading classes. This saves a lot of time at start-up and keeps the JVM memory footprint down, too. As the Plugin Manager gets used for more classes, this will become a greater concern.</p><p>The only downside of "on-demand" loading is that errors in the configuration don't get discovered right away. The solution is to call the <code class="literal">checkConfiguration()</code> method after making any changes to the configuration.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N140E7"></a><a name="docbook-business.html-pluginmethods"></a>PluginManager Class</h4></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">PluginManager</code> class is your main interface to the Plugin Manager.

These are the three optional steps where the item can be viewed and corrected by different groups of people. Actually, it's more like 8 states, with STEP_1_POOL, STEP_2_POOL, and STEP_3_POOL. These pooled states are when items are waiting to enter the primary states.</p><p>The WorkflowManager is invoked by events. While an Item is being submitted, it is held by a WorkspaceItem. Calling the start() method in the WorkflowManager converts a WorkspaceItem to a WorkflowItem, and begins processing the WorkflowItem's state. Since all three steps of the workflow are optional, if no steps are defined, then the Item is simply archived.</p><p>Workflows are set per Collection, and steps are defined by creating corresponding entries in the List named workflowGroup. If you wish the workflow to have a step 1, use the administration tools for Collections to create a workflow Group with members who you want to be able to view and approve the Item, and the workflowGroup[0] becomes set with the ID of that Group.</p><p>If a step is defined in a Collection's workflow, then the WorkflowItem's state is set to that step_POOL. This pooled state is the WorkflowItem waiting for an EPerson in that group to claim the step's task for that WorkflowItem. The WorkflowManager emails the members of that Group notifying them that there is a task to be performed (the text is defined in config/emails,) and when an EPerson goes to their 'My DSpace' page to claim the task, the WorkflowManager is invoked with a claim event, and the WorkflowItem's state advances from STEP_x_POOL to STEP_x (where x is the corresponding step.) The EPerson can also generate an 'unclaim' event, returning the WorkflowItem to the STEP_x_POOL.</p><p>Other events the WorkflowManager handles are advance(), which advances the WorkflowItem to the next state. If there are no further states, then the WorkflowItem is removed, and the Item is then archived. An EPerson performing one of the tasks can reject the Item, which stops the workflow, rebuilds the WorkspaceItem for it and sends a rejection note to the submitter. More drastically, an abort() event is generated by the admin tools to cancel a workflow outright.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N14359"></a>10.5.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-business.html-administer"></a>Administration Toolkit</h2></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">org.dspace.administer</code> package contains some classes for administering a DSpace system that are not generally needed by most applications.</p><p>The <code class="literal">CreateAdministrator</code> class is a simple command-line tool, executed via <code class="literal">/dspace/bin/create-administrator</code>, that creates an administrator e-person with information entered from standard input. This is generally used only once when a DSpace system is initially installed, to create an initial administrator who can then use the Web administration UI to further set up the system. This script does not check for authorization, since it is typically run before there are any e-people to authorize! Since it must be run as a command-line tool on the server machine, generally this shouldn't cause a problem. A possibility is to have the script only operate when there are no e-people in the system already, though in general, someone with access to command-line scripts on your server is probably in a position to do what they want anyway!</p><p>The <code class="literal">DCType</code> class is similar to the <code class="literal">org.dspace.content.BitstreamFormat</code> class. It represents an entry in the Dublin Core type registry, that is, a particular element and qualifier, or unqualified element. It is in the <code class="literal">administer</code> package because it is only generally required when manipulating the registry itself. Elements and qualifiers are specified as literals in <code class="literal">org.dspace.content.Item</code> methods and the <code class="literal">org.dspace.content.DCValue</code> class. Only administrators may modify the Dublin Core type registry.</p><p>The <code class="literal">org.dspace.administer.RegistryLoader</code> class contains methods for initialising the Dublin Core type registry and bitstream format registry with entries in an XML file. Typically this is executed via the command line during the build process (see <code class="literal">build.xml</code> in the source.) To see examples of the XML formats, see the files in <code class="literal">config/registries</code> in the source directory. There is no XML schema, they aren't validated strictly when loaded in.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N14394"></a>10.6.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-business.html-eperson"></a>E-person/Group Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>DSpace keeps track of registered users with the <code class="literal">org.dspace.eperson.EPerson</code> class. The class has methods to create and manipulate an <code class="literal">EPerson</code> such as get and set methods for first and last names, email, and password. (Actually, there is no <code class="literal">getPassword()</code> method--an MD5 hash of the password is stored, and can only be verified with the <code class="literal">checkPassword()</code> method.) There are find methods to find an EPerson by email (which is assumed to be unique,) or to find all EPeople in the system.</p><p>The <code class="literal">EPerson</code> object should probably be reworked to allow for easy expansion; the current EPerson object tracks pretty much only what MIT was interested in tracking - first and last names, email, phone. The access methods are hardcoded and should probably be replaced with methods to access arbitrary name/value pairs for institutions that wish to customize what EPerson information is stored.</p><p>Groups are simply lists of <code class="literal">EPerson</code> objects. Other than membership, <code class="literal">Group</code> objects have only one other attribute: a name. Group names must be unique, so we have adopted naming conventions where the role of the group is its name, such as <code class="literal">COLLECTION_100_ADD</code>. Groups add and remove EPerson objects with <code class="literal">addMember()</code> and <code class="literal">removeMember()</code> methods. One important thing to know about groups is that they store their membership in memory until the <code class="literal">update()</code> method is called - so when modifying a group's membership don't forget to invoke <code class="literal">update()</code> or your changes will be lost! Since group membership is used heavily by the authorization system a fast <code class="literal">isMember()</code> method is also provided.</p><p>Another kind of Group is also implemented in DSpace--special Groups. The <code class="literal">Context</code> object for each session carries around a List of Group IDs that the user is also a member of--currently the MITUser Group ID is added to the list of a user's special groups if certain IP address or certificate criteria are met.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N143DB"></a>10.7.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-business.html-authorize"></a>Authorization</h2></div></div></div><p>The primary classes are:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

The policies are attached to resources (hence the name <code class="literal">ResourcePolicy</code>,) and detail who can perform that action. The resource can be any of the DSpace object types, listed in <code class="literal">org.dspace.core.Constants</code> (<code class="literal">BITSTREAM</code>, <code class="literal">ITEM</code>, <code class="literal">COLLECTION</code>, etc.) The 'who' is made up of EPerson groups. The actions are also in <code class="literal">Constants.java</code> (<code class="literal">READ</code>, <code class="literal">WRITE</code>, <code class="literal">ADD</code>, etc.) The only non-obvious actions are <code class="literal">ADD</code> and <code class="literal">REMOVE</code>, which are authorizations for container objects. To be able to create an Item, you must have <code class="literal">ADD</code> permission in a Collection, which contains Items. (Communities, Collections, Items, and Bundles are all container objects.)</p><p>Currently most of the read policy checking is done with items--communities and collections are assumed to be openly readable, but items and their bitstreams are checked. Separate policy checks for items and their bitstreams enables policies that allow publicly readable items, but parts of their content may be restricted to certain groups.</p><p>The <code class="literal">AuthorizeManager</code> class' <code class="literal">authorizeAction(Context, object, action)</code> is the primary source of all authorization in the system. It gets a list of all of the ResourcePolicies in the system that match the object and action. It then iterates through the policies, extracting the EPerson Group from each policy, and checks to see if the EPersonID from the Context is a member of any of those groups. If all of the policies are queried and no permission is found, then an <code class="literal">AuthorizeException</code> is thrown. An <code class="literal">authorizeAction()</code> method is also supplied that returns a boolean for applications that require higher performance.</p><p>ResourcePolicies are very simple, and there are quite a lot of them. Each can only list a single group, a single action, and a single object. So each object will likely have several policies, and if multiple groups share permissions for actions on an object, each group will get its own policy.

DSpace admins (ID=1) are automatically part of all groups, much like super-users in the Unix OS. The Context object also carries around a List of special groups, which are also first checked for membership. These special groups are used at MIT to indicate membership in the MIT community, something that is very difficult to enumerate in the database! When a user logs in with an MIT certificate or with an MIT IP address, the login code adds this MIT user group to the user's Context.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N1446A"></a>10.7.2.&nbsp;Miscellaneous Authorization Notes</h3></div></div></div><p>Where do items get their read policies?

There is also code in place to enable policies that are timed--have a start and end date. However, the admin tools to enable these sorts of policies have not been written.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N14470"></a>10.8.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-business.html-handle"></a>Handle Manager/Handle Plugin</h2></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">org.dspace.handle</code> package contains two classes; <code class="literal">HandleManager</code> is used to create and look up Handles, and <code class="literal">HandlePlugin</code> is used to expose and resolve DSpace Handles for the outside world via the CNRI Handle Server code.</p><p>Handles are stored internally in the <code class="literal">handle</code> database table in the form:</p><pre class="screen">

The first half of the search task is indexing, and <code class="literal">org.dspace.search.DSIndexer</code> is the indexing class, which contains <code class="literal">indexContent()</code> which if passed an <code class="literal">Item</code>, <code class="literal">Community</code>, or <code class="literal">Collection</code>, will add that content's fields to the index. The methods <code class="literal">unIndexContent()</code> and <code class="literal">reIndexContent()</code> remove and update content's index information. The <code class="literal">DSIndexer</code> class also has a <code class="literal">main()</code> method which will rebuild the index completely. This is invoked by the <code class="literal">dspace/bin/index-all</code> script. The intent was for the <code class="literal">main()</code> method to be invoked on a regular basis to avoid index corruption, but we have had no problem with that so far.</p><p>Which fields are indexed by <code class="literal">DSIndexer</code>? These fields are defined in dspace.cfg in the section "Fields to index for search" as name-value-pairs. The name must be unique in the form search.index.i (i is an arbitrary positive number). The value on the right side has a unique value again, which can be referenced in search-form (e.g. title, author). Then comes the metadata element which is indexed. '*' is a wildcard which includes all subelements. For example:</p><p>
        <code class="literal">search.index.4 = keyword:dc.subject.*</code>
      </p><p>tells the indexer to create a keyword index containing all dc.subject element values. Since the wildcard ('*') character was used in place of a qualifier, all subject metadata fields will be indexed (e.g. dc.subject.other, dc.subject.lcsh, etc)</p><p>By default, the fields shown in the <code class="literal">Indexed Fields</code> section below are indexed. These are hardcoded in the DSIndexer class. If any search.index.i items are specified in <code class="literal">dspace.cfg</code> these are used rather than these hardcoded fields.</p><p>The query class <code class="literal">DSQuery</code> contains the three flavors of <code class="literal">doQuery()</code> methods--one searches the DSpace site, and the other two restrict searches to Collections and Communities. The results from a query are returned as three lists of handles; each list represents a type of result. One list is a list of Items with matches, and the other two are Collections and Communities that match. This separation allows the UI to handle the types of results gracefully without resolving all of the handles first to see what kind of content the handle points to. The <code class="literal">DSQuery</code> class also has a <code class="literal">main()</code> method for debugging via command-line searches.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N14547"></a>10.9.1.&nbsp;Our Lucene Implementation</h3></div></div></div><p>Currently we have our own Analyzer and Tokenizer classes (<code class="literal">DSAnalyzer</code> and <code class="literal">DSTokenizer</code>) to customize our indexing. They invoke the stemming and stop word features within Lucene. We create an <code class="literal">IndexReader</code> for each query, which we now realize isn't the most efficient use of resources - we seem to run out of filehandles on really heavy loads. (A wildcard query can open many filehandles!) Since Lucene is thread-safe, a better future implementation would be to have a single Lucene IndexReader shared by all queries, and then is invalidated and re-opened when the index changes. Future API growth could include relevance scores (Lucene generates them, but we ignore them,) and abstractions for more advanced search concepts such as booleans.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N14559"></a>10.9.2.&nbsp;Indexed Fields</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">DSIndexer</code> class shipped with DSpace indexes the Dublin Core metadata in the following way:</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="0"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

If four items have the same author, that author will appear in the index only once. Hence, the index of authors may be greater or smaller than the index of titles; items often have more than one author, though the same author may have authored several items.</p><p>The author indexing in the browse API does have limitations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> Ideally, a name that appears as an author for more than one item would appear in the author index only once. For example, 'Doe, John' may be the author of tens of items. However, in practice, author's names often appear in slightly differently forms, for example:</p><pre class="screen">
Doe, John
Doe, John Stewart
Doe, John S.
</pre><p>Currently, the above three names would all appear as separate entries in the author index even though they may refer to the same author. In order for an author of several papers to be correctly appear once in the index, each item must specify <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> the same form of their name, which doesn't always happen in practice.</p></li><li><p> Another issue is that two authors may have the same name, even within a single institution. If this is the case they may appear as one author in the index.</p></li></ul></div><p>These issues are typically resolved in libraries with <span class="emphasis"><em>authority control records</em></span>, in which are kept a 'preferred' form of the author's name, with extra information (such as date of birth/death) in order to distinguish between authors of the same name. Maintaining such records is a huge task with many issues, particularly when metadata is received from faculty directly rather than trained library cataloguers. For these reasons, DSpace does not yet feature 'authority control' functionality.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Date of Issue</span></dt><dd><p> Items are indexed by date of issue. This may be different from the date that an item appeared in DSpace; many items may have been originally published elsewhere beforehand. The Dublin Core field used is <span class="bold"><strong>date.issued</strong></span>. The ordering of this index may be reversed so 'earliest first' and 'most recent first' orderings are possible.</p><p>Note that the index is of <span class="emphasis"><em>items by date</em></span>, as opposed to an index of <span class="emphasis"><em>dates</em></span>. If 30 items have the same issue date (say 2002), then those 30 items all appear in the index adjacent to each other, as opposed to a single 2002 entry.</p><p>Since dates in DSpace Dublin Core are in ISO8601, all in the UTC time zone, a simple alphanumeric sort is sufficient to sort by date, including dealing with varying granularities of date reasonably.

        Ridiculous Example Titles:  I'm Out of Ideas
</pre><p>Note that in the case of title and date browses, <code class="literal">Item</code> objects are returned as opposed to actual titles. In these cases, you can specify the 'focus' to be a specific item, or a partial or full literal value. In the case of a literal value, if no entry in the index matches exactly, the closest match is used as the focus. It's quite reasonable to specify a focus of a single letter, for example.</p><p>Being able to specify a specific item to start at is particularly important with dates, since many items may have the save issue date. Say 30 items in a collection have the issue date 2002. To be able to page through the index 20 items at a time, you need to be able to specify exactly which item's 2002 is the focus of the browse, otherwise each time you invoked the browse code, the results would start at the first item with the issue date 2002.</p><p>Author browses return <code class="literal">String</code> objects with the actual author names. You can only specify the focus as a full or partial literal <code class="literal">String</code>.</p><p>Another important point to note is that presently, the browse indices contain metadata for all items in the main archive, regardless of authorization policies. This means that all items in the archive will appear to all users when browsing. Of course, should the user attempt to access a non-public item, the usual authorization mechanism will apply. Whether this approach is ideal is under review; implementing the browse API such that the results retrieved reflect a user's level of authorization may be possible, but rather tricky.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N14719"></a>10.10.2.&nbsp;Index Maintenance</h3></div></div></div><p>The browse API contains calls to add and remove items from the index, and to regenerate the indices from scratch. In general the content management API invokes the necessary browse API calls to keep the browse indices in sync with what is in the archive, so most applications will not need to invoke those methods.</p><p>If the browse index becomes inconsistent for some reason, the <code class="literal">InitializeBrowse</code> class is a command line tool (generally invoked using the <code class="literal">/dspace/bin/index-all</code> shell script) that causes the indices to be regenerated from scratch.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N14729"></a>10.10.3.&nbsp;Caveats</h3></div></div></div><p>Presently, the browse API is not tremendously efficient. 'Indexing' takes the form of simply extracting the relevant Dublin Core value, normalising it (lower-casing and removing any leading article in the case of titles), and inserting that normalized value with the corresponding item ID in the appropriate browse database table. Database views of this table include collection and community IDs for browse operations with a limited scope. When a browse operation is performed, a simple <code class="literal">SELECT</code> query is performed, along the lines of:</p><pre class="screen">
SELECT item_id FROM ItemsByTitle ORDER BY sort_title OFFSET 40 LIMIT
	20
</pre><p>There are two main drawbacks to this: Firstly, <code class="literal">LIMIT</code> and <code class="literal">OFFSET</code> are PostgreSQL-specific keywords. Secondly, the database is still actually performing dynamic sorting of the titles, so the browse code as it stands will not scale particularly well. The code does cache <code class="literal">BrowseInfo</code> objects, so that common browse operations are performed quickly, but this is not an ideal solution.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N14744"></a>10.11.&nbsp;<a name="docbook-business.html-checker"></a>Checksum checker</h2></div></div></div><p>The architecture of the checker is documented in the package javadocs, run <code class="literal">cd [dspace-source]/dspace;mvn javadoc:javadoc</code>, and look in <code class="literal">[dspace-source]dspace-api/target/site/apidocs/index.html</code>.</p></div></div><HR><p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; 2002-2009
