# This is a simple shell script for running a command-line DSpace tool.
# It sets the CLASSPATH appropriately before invoking Java.

USAGE="dsrun <classname> [arg1 [arg2 ...]]"

# Check we have at least one command-line argument
if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
    echo $USAGE
    exit 1

# Assume we're in the bin subdirectory of the DSpace installation directory
BINDIR=`dirname $0`
DSPACEDIR=`cd "$BINDIR/.." ; pwd`

# Get the JARs in $DSPACEDIR/jsp/WEB-INF/lib, separated by ':'
JARS=`echo $DSPACEDIR/lib/*.jar | sed 's/ /\:/g'`

# Class path for DSpace will be:
#   Any existing classpath
#   The JARs (WEB-INF/lib/*.jar)
#   The WEB-INF/classes directory
FULLPATH=$CLASSPATH:$JARS:$DSPACEDIR/config

# Now invoke Java
