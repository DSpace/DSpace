# It sets the CLASSPATH appropriately before invoking Java.

DSPACEDIR=`cd "$BINDIR/.." ; pwd`

# Get the JARs in $DSPACEDIR/jsp/WEB-INF/lib, separated by ':'
JARS=`echo $DSPACEDIR/lib/*.jar | sed 's/ /\:/g'`

# Class path for DSpace will be:

#   The JARs (WEB-INF/lib/*.jar)
#   The WEB-INF/classes directory
