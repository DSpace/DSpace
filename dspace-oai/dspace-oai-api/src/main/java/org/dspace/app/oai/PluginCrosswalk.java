/**
 * An OAICat Crosswalk implementation that calls, in turn, on
 * <code>DisseminationCrosswalk</code> plugins.
 * It is configured so its "OAI schema label" matches the name of a
 * <code>DisseminationCrosswalk</code> plugin.  This class
 * will then recognize its name and invoke the correct crosswalk
 * to produce the results it sends out.
 * <p>
 * <b>Configuration:</b>
 * In the OAICat configuration file (e.g. <code>oaicat.properties</code>
 * add a line like this for each plugin crosswalk you wish to provide:
 * <pre>
 *   Crosswalks.<cite>Plugin-Name</cite>=org.dspace.app.oai.PluginCrosswalk
 *
 *    e.g.
 *
 *   Crosswalks.DC=org.dspace.app.oai.PluginCrosswalk
 * </pre>
 * This creates an OAI metadata prefix "DC" which is implemented
 * by the dissemination crosswalk plugin that answers to the name "DC".
 * It, in turn, could be found in the DSpace configuration in a line like:
 * <pre>
 *  plugin.named.org.dspace.content.crosswalk.DisseminationCrosswalk = \
 *    org.dspace.content.crosswalk.SimpleDCDisseminationCrosswalk = DC
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that all OAI crosswalks are instances of this same class, since
 * the instance gets bound to a specific <code>DisseminationCrosswalk</code>
 * when it is created.
 * <p>
 *  WARNING: This requires at the OAICAT java library version 1.5.38.
 *    It does NOT work with some older versions.
