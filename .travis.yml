#  -P-assembly   => Disable build of dspace-installer in [src]/dspace/, as it can be memory intensive

# After a successful build and test (see 'script'), aggregate code coverage reports & send to coveralls.io
# (using the 'coveralls' profile). Skips 'assembly' step to save time.
# NOTE: also skips any code checks or compilation, as both are unnecessary. Coverage reports were already generated
# by jacoco-maven-plugin during the unit or integration testing. So, this command is aggregating existing reports.
