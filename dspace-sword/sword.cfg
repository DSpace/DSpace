# tell the SWORD METS implementation which package ingester to use
# to install deposited content.  This should refer to one of the
# classes configured for:
#
# plugin.named.org.dspace.content.packager.PackageIngester
#
# The value of sword.mets-ingester.package-ingester tells the
# system which named plugin for this interface should be used
# to ingest SWORD METS packages
#
# The default is METS
#
# sword.mets-ingester.package-ingester = METS

# Define the metadata type EPDCX (EPrints DC XML)
# to be handled by the SWORD crosswalk configuration
#
mets.submission.crosswalk.EPDCX = SWORD

# define the stylesheet which will be used by the self-named
# XSLTIngestionCrosswalk class when asked to load the SWORD
# configuration (as specified above).  This will use the
# specified stylesheet to crosswalk the incoming SWAP metadata
# to the DIM format for ingestion
#
crosswalk.submission.SWORD.stylesheet = crosswalks/sword-swap-ingest.xsl

# The base URL of the SWORD deposit.  This is the URL from
# which DSpace will construct the deposit location urls for
# collections.
#
# The default is {dspace.url}/sword/deposit
#
# In the event that you are not deploying DSpace as the ROOT
# application in the servlet container, this will generate
# incorrect URLs, and you should override the functionality
# by specifying in full as below:
#
# sword.deposit.url = http://www.myu.ac.uk/sword/deposit

# The base URL of the SWORD service document.  This is the
# URL from which DSpace will construct the service document
# location urls for the site, and for individual collections
#
# The default is {dspace.url}/sword/servicedocument
#
# In the event that you are not deploying DSpace as the ROOT
# application in the servlet container, this will generate
# incorrect URLs, and you should override the functionality
# by specifying in full as below:
#
# sword.servicedocument.url = http://www.myu.ac.uk/sword/servicedocument

# The base URL of the SWORD media links.  This is the URL
# which DSpace will use to construct the media link urls
# for items which are deposited via sword
#
# The default is {dspace.url}/sword/media-link
#
# In the event that you are not deploying DSpace as the ROOT
# application in the servlet container, this will generate
# incorrect URLs, and you should override the functionality
# by specifying in full as below:
#
# sword.media-link.url = http://www.myu.ac.uk/sword/media-link

# The URL which identifies the sword software which provides
# the sword interface.  This is the URL which DSpace will use
# to fill out the atom:generator element of its atom documents.
#
# The default is:
#
# http://www.dspace.org/ns/sword/1.3.1
#
# If you have modified your sword software, you should change
# this URI to identify your own version.  If you are using the
# standard dspace-sword module you will not, in general, need
# to change this setting
#
# sword.generator.url = http://www.dspace.org/ns/sword/1.3.1

# The metadata field in which to store the updated date for
# items deposited via SWORD.
#
sword.updated.field = dc.date.updated

# The metadata field in which to store the value of the slug
# header if it is supplied
#

# quality values where appropriate.

# Should the server offer up items in collections as sword deposit
# targets.  This will be effected by placing a URI in the collection
# description which will list all the allowed items for the depositing
# user in that collection on request
#
# NOTE: this will require an implementation of deposit onto items, which
# will not be forthcoming for a short while
#
sword.expose-items = false

# Should the server offer as the default the list of all Communities
# to a Service Document request.  If false, the server will offer
# the list of all collections, which is the default and recommended
# behaviour at this stage.
#
# NOTE: a service document for Communities will not offer any viable
# deposit targets, and the client will need to request the list of
# Collections in the target before deposit can continue
#
sword.expose-communities = false

# The maximum upload size of a package through the sword interface,
# in bytes
#
# This will be the combined size of all the files, the metadata and
# any manifest data.  It is NOT the same as the maximum size set
# for an individual file upload through the user interface.  If not
# set, or set to 0, the sword service will default to no limit.
#
sword.max-upload-size = 0

# Should DSpace store a copy of the original sword deposit package?
#
# NOTE: this will cause the deposit process to run slightly slower,
# and will accelerate the rate at which the repository consumes disk
# space.  BUT, it will also mean that the deposited packages are
# recoverable in their original form.  It is strongly recommended,
# therefore, to leave this option turned on
#
# When set to "true", this requires that the configuration option
# "upload.temp.dir" above is set to a valid location
#
sword.keep-original-package = true

# The bundle name that SWORD should store incoming packages under if
# sword.keep-original-package is set to true.  The default is "SWORD"
# if not value is set

# Should the server identify the sword version in deposit response?
#
# It is recommended to leave this enabled.
#
sword.identify-version = true

# Should we support mediated deposit via sword?  Enabled, this will
# allow users to deposit content packages on behalf of other users.
#
# See the SWORD specification for a detailed explanation of deposit
# On-Behalf-Of another user
#
sword.on-behalf-of.enable = true

# Configure the plugins to process incoming packages.  The form of this
# configuration is as per the Plugin Manager's Named Plugin documentation:
#
# plugin.named.[interface] = [implementation] = [package format identifier] \
#
# Package ingesters should implement the SWORDIngester interface, and
# will be loaded when a package of the format specified above in:
#
# sword.accept-packaging.[package format].identifier = [package format identifier]
#
# is received.
#
# In the event that this is a simple file deposit, with no package
# format, then the class named by "SimpleFileIngester" will be loaded
# and executed where appropriate.  This case will only occur when a single
# file is being deposited into an existing DSpace Item
