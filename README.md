:warning: **Work on DSpace 7 has begun on our `master` branch.** This means that there is temporarily NO user interface on this `master` branch. DSpace 7 will feature a new, unified [Angular](https://angular.io/) user interface, along with an enhanced, rebuilt REST API. The latest status of this work can be found on the [DSpace 7 UI Working Group](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+7+UI+Working+Group) page.  Additionally, the codebases can be found in the following places:
  * DSpace 7 REST API work is occurring on the [`master` branch](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/tree/master/dspace-spring-rest) of this repository.
     * The REST Contract is being documented at https://github.com/DSpace/Rest7Contract
  * DSpace 7 Angular UI work is occurring at https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular
  
**If you would like to get involved in our DSpace 7 development effort, we welcome new contributors.** Just join one of our meetings or get in touch via Slack. See the [DSpace 7 UI Working Group](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+7+UI+Working+Group) wiki page for more info.

**If you are looking for the ongoing maintenance work for DSpace 6 (or prior releases)**, you can find that work on the corresponding maintenance branch (e.g. [`dspace-6_x`](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/tree/dspace-6_x)) in this repository.

## Contributing

DSpace is a community built and supported project. We do not have a centralized development or support team, 
but have a dedicated group of volunteers who help us improve the software, documentation, resources, etc.

We welcome contributions of any type. Here's a few basic guides that provide suggestions for contributing to DSpace:
* [How to Contribute to DSpace](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/How+to+Contribute+to+DSpace): How to contribute in general (via code, documentation, bug reports, expertise, etc)
* [Code Contribution Guidelines](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Code+Contribution+Guidelines): How to give back code or contribute features, bug fixes, etc.
* [DSpace Community Advisory Team (DCAT)](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/cmtygp/DSpace+Community+Advisory+Team): If you are not a developer, we also have an interest group specifically for repository managers. The DCAT group meets virtually, once a month, and sends open invitations to join their meetings via the [DCAT mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/DSpaceCommunityAdvisoryTeam).

We also encourage GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) at any time. Please see our [Development with Git](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Development+with+Git) guide for more info.
