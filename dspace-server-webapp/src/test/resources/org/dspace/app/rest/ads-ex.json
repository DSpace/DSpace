                "abstract": "On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 ×10<SUP>-21</SUP>. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 σ . The source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0<SUB>-180</SUB><SUP>+160</SUP> Mpc corresponding to a redshift z =0.0 9<SUB>-0.04</SUB><SUP>+0.03</SUP> . In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3 6<SUB>-4</SUB><SUP>+5</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 2 9<SUB>-4</SUB><SUP>+4</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , and the final black hole mass is 6 2<SUB>-4</SUB><SUP>+4</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , with 3. 0<SUB>-0.5</SUB><SUP>+0.5</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> c<SUP>2</SUP> radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.",

                "abstract": "On August 17, 2017 at 12∶41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0 ×10<SUP>4</SUP> years . We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 - 1.60 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , with the total mass of the system 2.7 4<SUB>-0.01</SUB><SUP>+0.04</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> . The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (90% probability) and had a luminosity distance of 4 0<SUB>-14</SUB><SUP>+8</SUP> Mpc , the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the γ -ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short γ -ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation, and cosmology.",
