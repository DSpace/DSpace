    <title>The DSpace Web API</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The REST back-end of DSpace.  A front-end program such as
      <a href='https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/'>dspace-angular</a>
      can use this to query, fetch and manipulate DSpace objects and related
      data.  The REST layer sits between front-ends and the DSpace business
      logic (chiefly in {@code dspace-api}).
    </p>

    <p>Where To Find It:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Endpoint access authorization:  {@link org.dspace.app.rest.security}</li>
    </ul>
