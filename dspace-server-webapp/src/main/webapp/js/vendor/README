This folder contains two Javascript tools borrowed from Spring Data REST v3.3.x customizations of the HAL Browser:

- CustomPostForm.js copied over from
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-rest/blob/3.3.x/spring-data-rest-hal-browser/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring-data-rest/hal-browser/js/CustomPostForm.js
      - In Spring Data REST v3.3.x, this custom form was installed into the HAL Browser dynamically.
- jsoneditor.js is required by CustomPostForm.js.  We've updated it to the latest version currently available at
  https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor
      - json-editor doesn't appear to be available via webjars, so it must be included directly in our codebase.
