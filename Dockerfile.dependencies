# This image will be published as dspace/dspace-dependencies
# The purpose of this image is to make the build for dspace/dspace run faster
#

# This Dockerfile uses JDK11 by default, but has also been tested with JDK17.
# To build with JDK17, use "--build-arg JDK_VERSION=17"
ARG JDK_VERSION=11

# Step 1 - Run Maven Build

# Trigger the installation of all maven dependencies (hide download progress messages)
# Maven flags here ensure that we skip final assembly, skip building test environment and skip all code verification checks.
# These flags speed up this installation as much as reasonably possible.

# Clear the contents of the /app directory (including all maven builds), so no artifacts remain.
# This ensures when dspace:dspace is built, it will use the Maven local cache (~/.m2) for dependencies
