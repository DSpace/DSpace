/**
 * This Cocoon generator will generate an internal cocoon request for the next

 * 
 * The first time this generator is called it will issue a request for Aspect 2,
 * while it dose this it will store the aspect number in the request object.
 * Every time after the initial use the aspect number is increased and used to
 * generate the next Aspect url.

 * This class extends the FileGenerator and simple intercepts the setup method
 * ignoring anything passed in as the generators source and determines it's own
 * source based upon the current Aspect state.
