/**
 * Class will read the DSpace configuration file via the ConfigurationManager
 * 
 * It accepts the name of the property to read and the name of the variable to
 * use in the sitemap scope.  
 * For example:
 * 		<map:act type="DSpacePropertyFileReader">
 *			<map:parameter name="dspace.dir" value="dspace_dir" />
 *			<map:transform type="Include" src="{dspace_dir}/config/news.xml" /> 
 *		</map:act>
 * Will place the value of the "dspace.dir" property in the "dspace_dir" variable to be
 * used in the sitemap.
