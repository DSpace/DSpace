			The theme's pipeline is used to process all requests handled 
			by the theme. It is broken up into two parts, the first part 
			handles all static theme content while the second part handle 
			all dynamic aspect generated content. The static content is 
			such things as stylesheets, images, or static pages. Typically 
			these are just stored on disk and passed directly to the 
			browser without any processing.

			<!-- Aspect content 
			
			There are five steps to processing aspect content:
				
			1: Generate the DRI page
				
				The first step is to generate a DRI page for the request; 
				this is handled by the aspect chain. Once it is generated 
				it is the beginning of a theme's pipeline, the DRI page is 
				ultimately transformed in the resulting XHTML that is 
				given to the user's browser.
				
			2: Add page metadata
				
				The next step is to add theme specific metadata to the 
				DRI page. This is metadata about where the theme is 
				located and its name. Typically this metadata is different 
				depending on the users browser, this allows us to give 
				different stylesheets to Internet Explorer than for other 
				browsers.
				
			3: Transform to XHTML
				
				The third step is the main component of a theme the XSL 
				transformations will turn the DRI page from the aspects 
				into an XHTML page useable by browsers. 
				
			4: Localize the page
				
				The second to last step is to localize the content for the 
				particular user, if they user is requesting a page in a 
				particular language then those language strings are inserted 
				into the resulting XHTML.  
				
			5: Serialize to the browser
				
				The last step sends the page to the user's browser.
