 * A class representing a list item.

 * The item element in a list serves a dual purpose. It can contain other lists,

 * character container to display textual data, possibly enhanced with
 * hyperlinks, emphasized blocks of text, images and form fields. An item cannot
 * be both a character container and contain a list.
