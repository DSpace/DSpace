 * catalogue, a key, and a set of dictionary parameters. The catalogue tells 
 * the translater where to find the key, the key tells the transformer which 
 * specific text should be used, and the parameters provide for non translated 
 * data to be inserted into the resulting string.
 * 
 * This class design such that the Message object can be made static my any 
 * class that needs to use it. If dicionary parameters are used then a new 
 * instance is created specificaly for those parameters, this prevents 
 * concurent threads from over writting parameters of each other.
