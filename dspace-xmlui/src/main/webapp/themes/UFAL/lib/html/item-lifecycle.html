      <h3 id="submitted-item">Submitted Item</h3>
      <p>After you <a href="deposit">deposit</a> a submission it will be inserted into a 
      pool of submitted items. The item is not publicly available and waits for an editor
      to approve (or reject) it.    
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="edited-item">Edited Item</h3>
      <p>The task of the editor is to verify whether the submission meets our requirements in respect to 
      metadata quality and completeness, bitstream consistency and IPR. The editor can return the submission to the data depositor 
      describing the needed changes. This step is repeated until the editor approves the item. The approved item becomes a 
      published item. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="published-item">Published Item</h3>
      <p>A published item obtains a PID (persistent identifier) which should be used for referencing and citing e.g., 
      <strong>http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-097C-0000-0022-F59C-8</strong>. The LINDAT repository will ensure that
      the PID (more precisely, we use http handle proxy of the PID) will be resolved into a working web page (even if the current
          server infrastructure changes or is moved)
      describing your resource.    
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Published items are available through our search interface, browsing mode. Metadata of all items are submitted to 
      search engines and are available through OAI-PMH protocol (several institutes harvest our repository for item's metadata
      e.g., <a href="http://catalog.clarin.eu/vlo/">http://catalog.clarin.eu/vlo/</a>). Bitstreams of public submissions
          (see <a href="#restricted-submissions">Restricted Submissions</a>) are also available through OAI-ORE protocol.

      <h3 id="modifying-item">Deleting and Modifying of Published Item</h3>
      <p>Anybody can request deletion of published items; however, these will be evaluated on case-by-case basis.
      Furthermore, we reserve the right to keep the metadata of published submissions available
      in case there is no specific reason why to delete the metadata. The reason is that it is against
      the concept of PIDs (<strong>persistent</strong> identifiers).
      All PIDs are available through OAI-PMH interface even if only to inform that the item
      has been deleted.    
      </p>
      
      <p>We allow for minor edits of the submission (e.g., typos) through our <strong>Help Desk</strong>. These are also
      evaluated on case-by-case basis. For major changes, the user is requested to submit a new version of that item
      and we will indicate in the metadata that it is replaced by a newer version. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="restricted-submissions">Restricted Submissions</h3>
      <p>First of all, all metadata are always publicly available. We 
      support open access submissions; however, we also support 
      <strong>restrictive licences</strong> for bitstreams which require e-signing before downloading the bitstreams.
      We keep track of these e-signatures in case there are IPR infringements.</p>
      
       <p><a href="licenses">See currently available licenses</a> or <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">ask us</a>
      to add a specific one.</p>
      
      <p>We also support putting embargo on bitstreams which means that the bitstreams become publicly available
      after specific dates.</p>
