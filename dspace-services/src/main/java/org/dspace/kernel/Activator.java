/**
 * An activator is a special type which allows a provider to be plugged into the system by dropping a jar file
 * in with the kernel and adding in a hook in the configuration file. Activators are started after the
 * initial classes and the service manager have already been started. All classes which implement this
 * must have a public empty constructor (takes no parameters) (e.g.
 * {@code public MyClass() {}} )
 * <p>
 * If you want the system to execute your class then you must list it in
 * the DSpace configuration with the fully qualified classpath
 * (NOTE that the xxx can be anything as long as it is unique): <br>
 * {@code activator.xxx = org.dspace.MyClass}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link #start(ServiceManager)} will be called after the class is created during kernel startup.
 * Developers should create their providers/plugins/etc. in this method and
 * use the registration methods in the {@link ServiceManager} to register them.
 * {@link #stop(ServiceManager)} will be called when the kernel shuts down. Perform any cleanup/shutdown actions
 * you like during this phase (unregistering your services here is a good idea). <br>
 * </p>
 * <p>This is modeled after the OSGi {@code BundleActivator}.</p>
 * <p>
 * There is another type of activator used in DSpace but it is
 * configured via the configuration service only.  The class activator
 * is configured by creating a config property like this
 * (NOTE that the xxx can be anything as long as it is unique): <br>
 * {@code activator.class.xxx = org.dspace.MyClass;org.dspace.MyServiceName;constructor}<br>
 * Unlike the normal activators, these are started up when the kernel
 * core services start and thus can actually be accessed from the
 * service manager and referenced in providers and plugins.
 * </p>
