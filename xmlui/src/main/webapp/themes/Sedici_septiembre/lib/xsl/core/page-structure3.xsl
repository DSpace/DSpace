        The starting point of any XSL processing is matching the root element. In DRI the root element is document,
        which contains a version attribute and three top level elements: body, options, meta (in that order).

        This template creates the html document, giving it a head and body. A title and the CSS style reference
        are placed in the html head, while the body is further split into several divs. The top-level div
        directly under html body is called "ds-main". It is further subdivided into:
            "ds-header"  - the header div containing title, subtitle, trail and other front matter
            "ds-body"    - the div containing all the content of the page; built from the contents of dri:body
            "ds-options" - the div with all the navigation and actions; built from the contents of dri:options
            "ds-footer"  - optional footer div, containing misc information

        The order in which the top level divisions appear may have some impact on the design of CSS and the
        final appearance of the DSpace page. While the layout of the DRI schema does favor the above div
        arrangement, nothing is preventing the designer from changing them around or adding new ones by
        overriding the dri:document template.
